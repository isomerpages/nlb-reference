### <u>Introduction</u>


Georgette Chen Li Ying, born Chang Li Ying, was a Singaporean artist known for her still-life and figure/landscape portraits in oil. She also worked with other mediums such as watercolour and pastels. Although the location and year of Chen’s birth had been disputed, it is generally agreed that she was born in 1906 in Zhejiang Province, China. She passed away in Singapore in 1993.

Chen experienced a cosmopolitan and transcontinental life, traversing nations such as China, France, and the United States for much of her life and moving to Singapore permanently around 1953, after which she started teaching at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). She acquired Singaporean citizenship upon Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965.

In recognition of her achievements, Chen was awarded the Cultural Medallion (Fine Art) in 1982. A retrospective exhibition was held in her honour at the National Museum in 1985, wherein over 170 of her works were displayed. Chen passed away in 1993 at the Mount Alvernia Hospital. Chen’s legacy in the Singaporean cultural imaginary is evidenced in the multiple creative works inspired by her—playwright Ng Yi-Sheng’s musical, *Georgette: The Musical*, staged for the 2007 edition of the Singapore Arts Festival by Musical Theatre Limited; illustrator Sonny Liew’s Chen-inspired graphic novel published in 2014; and the series of docudramas based on her life commissioned by the National Gallery of Singapore in 2015.

An exhibition titled *Georgette Chen: At Home in the World*, the first museum retrospective of the artist in more than 20 years, is currently being staged at the National Gallery Singapore (from November 2020 to September 2021), where some of her key works are displayed alongside archival material.

  In this article, Georgette Chen explained that she was particularly attracted to paint landscapes and people (especially the lives of the common people) in her works. She had explored the techniques of the different schools and realised that she could not follow just any one of them. To Chen, it was important to use various colours and techniques so as to paint works that could truly represent the era that they lived in.

  Chia’s essay recuperates Chen as a feminist figure of empowerment in a time when the art world was male-dominated insofar as women were marginalised by the inimical conditions that impeded them from practicing art professionally. In the elaboration of her project, Chia also considers the recurring motifs, subject material, and formal strategies characteristic of Chen’s oeuvre.

  This paper considers the implications of socio-economic, historical, and political conditions on post-imperial Malaya’s cultural life and artistic development in the interim, interstitial period between the collapse of British colonialism and the formation of the Malaysian and Singaporean nation-states, arguing that art of that period can be located within the exigencies of modern(ist) nation-building.
