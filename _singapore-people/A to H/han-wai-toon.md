### <u>Introduction</u>

Han Wai Toon（韩槐准; 1892–1970) was born in 1892 in Hainan, China. Due to impoverished circumstances, he only started schooling at 14 and completed his primary education when he was 21. In 1913, together with friends, he ran a dye factory business after school. The business failed to take off and was forced to close down. He arrived in Singapore in 1915 and got a job as a clerk in a company in the Karimun islands. Due to the global demand for rubber at this time, a rubber plantation worker could get paid nearly 10 times more than a clerk and Han took on both jobs so as to earn enough to clear his debts incurred after his dye factory business failed. He joined his relative Foo Khee How in a medical office set up by German immigrants, working as a clerk-cum-dispenser.

For over 20 years, Han worked as a dispenser as well as in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Through diligent self-study, he accumulated knowledge in Chemistry and pharmaceutical science.

During this time, he also became interested in photography and began to study film processing techniques. He also started to be recognised for his photographic work.

In the 1930s, Han turned his interests to history and archaeology. He was especially interested in ancient Chinese ceramics and he read what he could find about these topics. With his accumulated knowledge of Chemistry and experience gained from work in the dye factory, he was able to estimate the age of a ceramic piece. He would study the transformation of the pigments in the underglaze under heat processing and cross-reference this information with his knowledge of when various colour and cobalt pigments were imported to China. He became an expert in Chinese ceramics.

He later purchased a property in Sembawang and built a garden known as 愚趣园 (Yu Qu Yuan) which would then become a place of leisure and art appreciation in the 1930s to the 1960s. His visitors and friends include the poet Yu Da Fu and the painter Xu Bei Hong.
