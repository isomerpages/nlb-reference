### <u>Introduction</u>

Chen Jen Hao (陈人浩; 1908 – 1976) was a pioneer artist and educator. Best known for his Chinese calligraphy, he was also adept at western painting. He received his art education in both Shanghai and Paris and took up a professorship at Shanghai Art Academy upon returning from Paris. Chen came to Malaya in 1937 upon the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and took up a teaching position in Muar. He moved to Singapore in 1956 where he was appointed the headmaster (afternoon session) of Kallang West Government Chinese Middle School (now Dunman High School) and later became its principal. Chen was active in the local art scene, such as participating in several art exhibitions and serving as president of the Society of Chinese Artists and honorary advisor to the Lee Kong Chian Museum of Asian Art at Nanyang University among others. He also actively participated in educational societies in both Malaya and Singapore.
