### <u>Introduction</u>

Huang Man Shi (黄曼士; 1890 – 1963), or Huang Cong (黄琮) or Huang Mun Se, was an art collector and a prominent personality of the Chinese community in Singapore. Huang arrived in Singapore in 1923 to assume the position of managing director at the Nanyang branch of the Brothers Tobacco Company Limited. He retired from business after the company folded. Huang was well-known for his friendship with celebrated Chinese painter, Xu Beihong, who regarded Huang as his benefactor and referred to him as his “second elder brother”. In 1954, the governor of Singapore appointed Huang, along with 17 others, as a member of the Chinese Advisory Board, a committee that provided advice on Chinese customs and traditions in Singapore. Huang was also involved in setting up Mee Toh School and was elected as the chairman of the school’s board in 1960. Huang took up leadership positions in the Huang Clan Singapore Association, South Seas Society and Nanyang Confucian Association. He passed away in October 1963.
