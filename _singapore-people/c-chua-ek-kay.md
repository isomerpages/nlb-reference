### <u>Introduction</u>

Chua Ek Kay (1947–2008) was a Singaporean visual artist and a Cultural Medallion recipient for Visual Arts in 1999. Chua worked primarily with ink as a paint medium and his works both constituted and later departed from the Chinese ink painting tradition. His iconic works include Song of the Cicada (1995), Street Scene at Jalan Sultan (1997), After the Rain (2004), and Morning Breeze in Early Summer (2006).

Born in China in 1947 but raised in Singapore from the age of six following his family’s relocation in the early 1950s, Chua was first introduced to Chinese aesthetics when he began learning Chinese calligraphy from his father at seven years old. He subsequently studied Chinese ink painting under Fan Chang Tien, a maestro whose artistic inclinations were resolutely that of the Shanghai School’s, in 1975 until Fan’s death in 1987. While Chua began teaching Chinese calligraphy and ink painting at the National University of Singapore’s now-defunct Extramural Studies Department in 1987, he did not, however, pursue a professional full-time career in fine art until the enthusiastic reception to his first solo exhibition, A Selection of Chua Ek Kay’s Chinese Brush Paintings, in 1988 ascertained the viability of such an option. Chua later enrolled in higher education to refine and further develop his craft—he graduated with an Advanced Diploma in Painting from LaSalle College of the Arts, Singapore in 1990 and a Master of Arts (Honours) in Visual Arts from the University of Western Sydney, Australia in 1995.

Following the success of Chinese Brush Paintings, Chua has held multiple solo exhibitions, such as Street Scene by Chua Ek Kay at Art Affairs in 1990 and Duality & Tension at the National Museum Art Gallery in 1992, and participated in just as many group exhibitions. He was the grand prize winner at the 10th United Overseas Bank Painting of the Year competition in 1991—the first Chinese ink painter to do so; he received a Distinction Award at the same competition the year before. Chua also won the Philip Morris ASEAN Arts Award (Juror’s Choice) in 1998 and secured a National Arts Council scholarship for practicing artists in 1993. In 1999, he received the prestigious Cultural Medallion for Visual Arts.

Chua’s body of work is arguably most notable for its renovation of conventional Chinese ink principles in both form and content, as informed and imparted by his transnational/cosmopolitan impulses (evidenced in his multiple excursions to locations such as Australia, India, Nepal, and Indonesia): for instance, his works deploy more colour than dictated by Chinese ink tradition and his subject matter incorporates local material, as attested to by his Chinatown series. This could perhaps be apprehended as an endeavour to reframe the practice as a Singaporean aesthetic. That Chua is inspired by Western artists such as Picasso and Matisse counterbalances his training in Chinese art; his oeuvre consequently communicates a distinctive synthesis of Chinese and Euro-American artistic traditions.

Chua passed away in 2008 and is survived by his wife and his son. In 2015, the newly-opened National Gallery Singapore honoured Chua with a posthumous large-scale solo exhibition, entitled Chua Ek Kay: After the Rain (as derived from one of his most representative works dated 2004), that affirmed his enduring significance in local/regional artistic circles and the legacy he bequeathed to Singaporean fine art. Today, his works are located in both local and overseas collections such as the Singapore Art Museum, the National Gallery, and Merrill Lynch International.
