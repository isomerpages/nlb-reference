### <u>Introduction</u>

| Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781–1826) was a British administrator and orientalist, whose name is synonymous with the British founding of Singapore. Less known is his period in Southeast Asia as Lieutenant Governor of Java (1811–1816) and Bencoolen (1818–1824). The span of British rule in Indonesia, beginning with the invasion of Java in 1811, was marked not just by an expansion in European knowledge of the Malay Archipelago but also an erosion of the powers of local sultanates. <br><br> This resource guide introduces the National Library of Singapore’s collection of materials on Raffles as a scholar and collector. It presents a selection of reference materials relating to the studies carried out by Raffles and his associates in Java and Sumatra, as well as the cultural and natural history objects that he had collected from the region. <br><br> This guide is not meant to be an exhaustive list on the subject. For more materials on this subject and other aspects of Raffles’s administration in Southeast Asia, please visit the library’s [catalogue](http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/). | ![Raffles image](/images/category/singaporeandsoutheastasia/Raffles-in-SEA-pic-1.jpg) <br><br> **Source: Collection of National Library Singapore, B29030508E** |
