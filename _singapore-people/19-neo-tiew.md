### <u>Introduction</u>

Neo Tiew (梁宙) (1884 – 1975), also known as 梁后宙, was born and raised in Nan’an County in Fujian Province, China. Due to his impoverished circumstances, he left home for Singapore in 1897. Among his many jobs, he worked in a provision shop, started a bullock cart business, and spent about two years in Selangor as rubber plantation supervisor. In 1912, his uncle handed over his brick-kiln business to him.

He became acquainted with landowner Alexander William Cashin, who was to become one of his biggest clients. In 1914, Cashin invited him to clear and develop his land at Lim Chu Kang. Together with 800 men, Neo Tiew planted pineapples, coconut and rubber trees. He eventually became the headman of Ama Keng Village, and led in the setting up of Kay Wah School (present day Qihua Primary School) and a maternity clinic at Lim Chu Kang.

Neo Tiew was one of the founding members of the Singapore Lam Ann Association, and very active in the anti-Japanese resistance movement before World War II. Unfortunately, during the Japanese Occupation, while he and his fourth son managed to escape to China, 35 of his family members were massacred. In memory of the sacrifices of his family in the anti-Japanese war, a calligraphy scroll signed by the Chairman of Chinese Government Overseas Chinese Affair Committee, Republic of China, was presented to him.

After the war, Neo Tiew returned to Singapore, rebuilt his life and established the Nam Hoe and Thong Hoe Villages (both named after the provision shops he opened there). The latter had a population of 10,000 by 1953. He was active in community work, clearing undeveloped areas and maintained law and order in the villages under his care.

He was conferred the Order of the British Empire in 1954 and honoured by King George VI with a certificate in recognition of his “many years of loyal and valuable work for Singapore and his community”. For his commitment to community work, he received a commendation certificate from the Singapore Government. Neo Tiew Road, Neo Tiew Crescent and Neo Tiew Lane are named after him.

He passed away aged 91 on 13 November 1975. He had six wives, 16 sons and 12 daughters.
