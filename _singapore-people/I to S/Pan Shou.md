# Pan Shou (潘受)

Pan Shou (潘受) (D. Litt) (b. 26 January 1911, Quanzhou, Fujian, China – d. 23 February 1999, Singapore) was a noted Chinese calligrapher and poet. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Pan, who was the founding secretary-general of Nanyang University, also worked in other roles, from being a newspaper editor to a bank manager. 

After his retirement, Pan devoted himself to calligraphy and poetry. This hobby, which ultimately became his passion, made him world-famous. He had practised calligraphy since he was eight, beginning with kaishu (楷书), the regular script used by the great Tang calligraphers. It was only in the last 25 years of his life that he began to focus on the xingshu (行书) script, which was a running or semicursive 
script. 

Pan had received various accolades for his artistic pursuits both in Singapore (such as Cultural Medallion Award (1987) and Meritorious Service Medal (1994) and overseas (such as a Gold medal at the Salon Artists Francais (1985),  Officier des Art et des Lettres (1991), and ASEAN Cultural Medal (1997).
