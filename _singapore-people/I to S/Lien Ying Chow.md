### <u>Introduction</u>

Lien Ying Chow (连瀛洲; 1906–2004) was from Chaoyang district in Guangdong, China. He left for Singapore in 1920 when he was 14, where he started working as a provision shop assistant. In 1929, he founded an import-export firm called Wah Hin and Company, which made a windfall from contracts to supply provisions to British forces in Singapore and Malaya. Respected by the Chinese business community, Lien was elected as the youngest president of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 1941.

In 1947, Lien founded the Overseas Union Bank (OUB), which opened for business two years later. By 1957, he had opened branches in Tokyo and London. OUB was one of Southeast Asia’s largest banks before it was acquired by the United Overseas Bank in 2001. Lien built a business empire in banking, hotels and property. After almost four decades, he realised his dream of building OUB’s headquarters, the OUB Centre, at 1 Raffles Place. It opened in 1988 and was then one of the world’s tallest buildings at 60 storeys. He retired as group chairman and director of OUB in 1995.

Lien was Singapore’s High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1966 to 1969. He was also active in philanthropic and community work. In 1980, he set up the Lien Foundation to continue his philanthropic work. He was the chairman of the Preservation of Monuments Board in 1972, and a member of the Board of Commissioners of Currency in 1973. He was elected chairman of the Ngee Ann Kongsi (1953/54–1963/64) and built the Ngee Ann Building. He was also one of the founders of Nanyang University and helped set up Ngee Ann College (now Ngee Ann Polytechnic). Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Lien Ying Chow Library and Lien Ying Chow Gallery are both named after him. He was the chairman of the first council of the National University of Singapore and served in that capacity for over a decade (1980–1992).

Lien was awarded the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal) in 1964. The following year, Lien was conferred the Third Class Order of the Crown of Thailand by then Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej for his role in promoting trade and friendship between the two countries. In 1981, Lien became one of the few non-Americans to receive the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement for building the five-star Mandarin Hotel, which was officially opened in 1973 and the first in Singapore to feature a revolving restaurant. He was named Businessman of the Year in 1988.

Lien was 98 when he passed away on 6 August 2004. He had four wives, four sons and four daughters.
