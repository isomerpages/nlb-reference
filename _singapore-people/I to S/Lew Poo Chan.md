# Lew Poo Chan (Dan Ying)

Lew Poo Chan (b. 1943, Kuala Kangsar, Perak, Malaya - ), better known by her pseudonym Dan Ying, is a well-known poet in Chinese-speaking communities around the world. Her poetry has won a number of literary awards and has been translated into several languages. For her contributions to literature, Lew was awarded the Cultural Medallion for Literature in 1996.

Lew stated writing poetry when she was studying in Taiwan because of her involvement in literary magazine, *Xing Zuo Shi Kan* (星座诗刊). Her first and second poetry anthologies, were published in 1966 and 1968 respectively by Xing Zuo Shi She (星座诗社). As result of the high standards she sets for herself, she is not a prolific writer and would often not publish poems that she was not satisfied with. Her third poetry anthology, *Poems of Taiji* (太极诗谱), was published only in 1979 some 11 years after her second publication. This was followed by *Ages on my Hair* (发上岁月), published in 1993 after a gap of more than 10 years. Both poetry collections won her the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Award. 

An esteemed poet in the international Chinese literary scene, many of Lew’s works have appeared in anthologies published in Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan. Some of her poems have also been translated into English, Malay and Korean. She was also picked as one of the top 10 Chinese women writers in the world at an international writer’s conference organised by Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

In Singapore, Lew’s poems were included in the 2006 pre-university syllabus for Chinese language and literature. Her poems were also displayed in Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train carriages as part of the initiative to introduce the works of local poets to the public in 1996.
