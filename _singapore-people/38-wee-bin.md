### <u>Introduction</u>

Wee Bin (黄敏; Huang Min) (1823, Fujian, China–1868, Singapore) was a prominent Chinese Hokkien merchant in the 19th century. He founded Wee Bin & Co. (chop Hong Guan), which was primarily a shipping company located on Market Street.

Wee Bin & Co. started off partnering businesses in Bali in the Dutch East Indies, and the company became the biggest importer of goods from Bali, trading in all manner of earthenware. The company grew to own as many as 20 ships, servicing the trade routes to China, Malaya and the East Indies.

Wee married twice and had a son, Wee Boon Teck, and a daughter who eventually married one of Wee’s employees, Lim Ho Puah. After Wee passed away in 1868, his son took over and expanded the business. After the deaths of both Wee Boon Teck and his son, the business was then helmed by Lim Ho Puah. The business was eventually liquidated when it was passed down to Lim’s son, Lim Peng Siang.
