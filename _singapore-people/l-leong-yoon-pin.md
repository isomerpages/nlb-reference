### <u>Introduction</u>

Leong Yoon Pin (梁荣平; b. 5 August 1931, Singapore–d. 13 April 2011, Singapore) was a composer, conductor and educator. Described as the doyen of Singapore composers, Leong was well-known for his choral compositions, many of which were locally commissioned and performed by both amateur and professional choirs. His compositions were often infused with a local flavour. Leong was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1982.

Call no.: RSING 784.2092 ABI

Abisheganaden recounts Leong’s formation of the Metro Philharmonic Society (MPS) in 1959, where he was invited to be Patron of the Society. Though Leong was founding member, he did not run the MPS autonomously, but also invited other conductors and composers to contribute to the Society’s activities. MPS also played an important role in premiering new works, many of which were Leong’s choral works. The author also brings up the subject of government support in the arts scene.

Call no.: RSING 959.57003 SIN

This essay traces the tradition of choral singing in Singapore, from its early years in 1819 when Stamford Raffles founded Singapore, to the new millennium. Chia situates the development of choral singing within Singapore’s religious, social, educational, and political environments, with the latter bearing the most significance. According to Chia, the Sino-Japanese war in the 1930s helped foster strong links between the Chinese communities in Singapore and China, and engendered much anti-Japanese sentiment as evident in the songs and lyrics sung by a growing number of choirs in Singapore. In addition to a brief comparison of different choral styles, Chia assesses the vocal quality and choral sound of Chinese choirs. Leong’s musical contributions and his involvement with the Metro Philharmonic Society are also mentioned.

Lee explores the aspect of intercultural musical synthesis in Leong’s compositions, in particular, the choral work Sunset (2005) written for the Singapore Youth Festival. He also considers factors such as Singapore’s colonial heritage and the consequent decolonization effects on Leong’s musical style. Lee looks at cultural theories in his concluding analysis and interpretation of Sunset, suggesting that Leong’s awakening to Asian consciousness and consequent attempt to bridge cultural disparities resulted in a distinctive musical pluralism evident in Sunset.

In this publication of The Singapore National Theatre Trust, Leong provides a brief introduction of local composers and their representative works. This essay was first written for the Asia Pacific Festival and Composers’ Conference in New Zealand in 1984. Leong comments on the first generation Singaporean composers, most of whom were self-taught or trained in other disciplines.
The second part of the essay discusses the developing musical scene in Singapore schools and the cultural environment. Leong concludes with his thoughts on the imminent problems faced by local composers in the 1980s. This magazine existed briefly between the years of 1984 to 1991, and publication ceased after the opening of the National Arts Council.

Writer Soh Kay Cheng, a retired professor from the National Institute of Education, assumed the pen name of DiAnn when he wrote this article for Leong’s 青春颂歌 concert on 25 October at Victoria Concert Hall. This article traces the development of Leong’s compositional style over three decades. The writer associates the composer’s musical training and various professional affiliations with the changes in style, from his early period prior to 1954, through to his Guildhall, France, and Newcastle periods. It is also suggested that in later years, Leong was able to assimilate both his vocal and instrumental styles. DiAnn surmises that it is the instrumental compositions, with its combination of eastern melodies and western modernity that truly reflect Leong’s maturing style in the 1980s.

Leong discusses his compositional habits, like preferring to work in the early hours of the morning while the world is “still and calm”. As in other interviews, Leong maintains that it is vital for a composer to be creative. This leads him to experiment with sound combinations and to “trying out new structures and ideas”. He further shares that the sources of his inspiration include Chinese classical literature, ethnic sounds, and art songs.

This is a preview of a concert presented by the Metro Philharmonic Society. Leong presents his work The Giving Tree, which calls for nearly a thousand chopsticks as percussion instruments. Based on the American fable by Shel Silverstein, Leong decided on the use of chopsticks as they are made of wood, and thus its association with the tree. Baritone Li Xinchang confessed being ‘bewildered by technical complexities, such as the augmented melodic movements of the work”.

Kong assesses the classical music environment in Singapore during the 1990s, and solicits comments from composers such as Leong, Bernard Tan, Joe Peters, and Er Yenn Chwen. She further offers suggestions on how to make local compositions more accessible to the public, which would in turn give due recognition to the composer.

This is a preview of Spring Songs, a concert given by the Metro Philharmonic Choir. Leong directs the choir in eleven songs that he had arranged for this performance. Instead of a piano, he uses the synthesizer as an accompaniment for its varied and interesting timbre. Other choral works on the programme included Nostalgia, Poem, and Dragon Dance. Leong also discusses the local choral scene and other works he has written for choir.

This is more an obituary for well-known Israeli conductor Shalom Ronly-Riklis, who was awarded the Public Service Star in 1992 for his promotion of musical activities in Singapore. Leong recalls that it was Ronly-Riklis who asked for a Singaporean work to conduct when he was guest conductor with SSO in 1980. This prompted Choo Hoey to ask for a composition from Leong, who obliged with the Dayong Sampan, the first work by a Singaporean to be performed by the SSO.

Tan investigates this altercation between SSO and Singaporean composers, set off by Shui Lan’s provocative comment that Singaporean composers “did not meet international standards”. Opinions were gathered from the local music community as well as from Singaporeans based overseas. In two short paragraphs, Leong shares his view on whether preferential treatment should be given to Singaporean artistes, arguing that local works should not be judged from a western perspective. He maintains that there should be a deliberate creation of space to expose and discover young musicians.

In this Chinese essay, Leong argues that Singapore does not yet have a common style as our ancestors from China, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia were preoccupied with survival issues and did not attempt to preserve their individual cultures. However, when Singapore became a British colony, we imported their musical traditions and forsook our own. To reclaim his roots, Leong draws upon Chinese folk elements, literature and poetry for inspiration. He also explores local and foreign poetry for subject matter. He cites his use of traditional instruments to add flavour to his compositions.

This is essentially publicity for the launch of the SSO’s Composers-in-Residence Scheme—a scheme made possible by the benefactors Mr and Mrs Goh Geok Khim. Leong was the choice composer of the Selection Committee. Shui Lan compares the then local music scene to “America in the early twentieth century where they were still unsure of their own musical identity and played more European music . . . this is a step forward for local music and composition . . .”.

This interview was conducted as a preview for Leong’s Piano Concerto that was to be premiered in January 2007. The composer also described how his earliest songs were borne out of the necessity of writing music that was not politically affiliated with China or Taiwan. This led to his investigation and fascination with the local soundscape of Indian labourers at work or the “tok tok mee” man.

In seven movements, this is an extended song cycle written early in Leong’s career (1969). The writing here is mostly tonal, with conventional harmonic progressions. Throughout Holiday Camp, Leong gives the pianist a more active involvement in the initiating of rhythms, melodies, and in mood setting. Though the piano writing can be awkward, there is a greater sense of purpose when tasked to provide counter melodies or rhythmic and melodic opposition to the voices.


* 梁荣平. [Liang, R. P.] (2007). [Nine cantos = 九歌](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/arts/web/contents/ArticleDetails.aspx?Id=24c9d811-fb5d-422f-82e0-ae6b156d47df) \[wav\]. Retrieved from NORA.

This is one of Leong’s more substantial choral work composed in 1986. Based on the work of poet patriot Qu Yuan who lived during the time of China’s Warring States Period, Nine Cantos is in eleven sections and is programmatic in nature. Set in the beautiful province of Hunan, the narrative elements in this poem allow for greater interplay between the voices and the supporting instruments, the piano and percussion. The varied timbre of the percussion instruments (glockenspiel, tambourine, temple bells, timpani, Chinese drum, etc.) provides Leong with the opportunity to characterize each section with a distinctive timbre. There is also greater independence of parts between the piano and percussion. Though the piano assumes a variety of styles across different movements, it is mostly cast in a supportive role, reinforcing choral parts, or sometimes offering momentum to relatively static vocal parts. The eleven sections: Monarch of the East 《东皇太一》, Lord of the Clouds 《云中君》, Lord and Lady of Xiang (1) 《湘君/湘夫人(上)》, Lord and Lady of Xiang (2) 《湘君/湘夫人(下)》, Master of Fate 《大司命》, Young Master of Fate (少司命), Lord of the East 《东君》, River Deity 《河伯》, Mountain Goddess 《山鬼》, Hymn of the Fallen Warriors 《国薚》 and Ritual Finale 《礼魂》.

Written in 1962, The text tells the story of ill-fated lovers destined to be together only in death. The vocal writing in The Peacock’s East-Southerly Flight is patriotic in style, with many recognizable pentatonic turns of phrase. Leong maintains that this is the influence of Teochew street operas or wayangs he witnessed in his youth.
