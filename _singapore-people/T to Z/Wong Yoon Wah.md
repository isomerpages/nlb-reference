**Wong Yoon Wah** (b. 13 August 1941, Perak, Malaysia–) is one of the few Singaporeans who excel as an international poet, critic and scholar.[^1] Prolific in both creative and academic writing, Wong has published more than 20 collections of prose, poetry, and academic writings on Chinese and comparative literature in Chinese and English.[^2] For his commitment to promoting literature regionally, Wong was awarded the Southeast Asia Write Award (1984), the [Cultural Medallion](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1867_2012-01-30.html) (1986), and the ASEAN Cultural Award (1993).[^3]

### Education and career

Born in Malaysia in 1941, Wong studied English literature at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, before pursuing his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chinese literature at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, USA.[^4] Following the completion of his doctoral studies, he came to Singapore in 1973 to teach at [Nanyang University](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_91_2005-02-02.html), and later became the head of the Department of Chinese Studies at the [National University of Singapore](National University of Singapore) (NUS).[^5] 

In 2002, Wong was appointed Dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Taiwan's Yuan Ze University, where he had served as the university's Faculty Professor of Chinese Language and Literature as well as Director of International Language and Culture Centre. He is currently Chair Professor and Senior Vice President of Malaysia’s Southern University College.[^6]
