### <u>Introduction</u>

Low Ing Sing (b. 1924, Sibu, Sarawak–d. 2002, Singapore) was a pioneer of Mandarin drama and theatre in Singapore. He was an actor, director, playwright, instructor and a critic. He wrote under various pen names such as Shao Fei, Kai Shan, Tian Shan and Jian Ke. Loh was awarded the Cultural Medallion Award for Theatre in 1985. His journey in the performing arts began when he picked up acting at a very young age. Low was also in Chung Cheng High School’s first cohort of students. Low eventually became a teacher and moved to Taiping, Malaysia in 1948 to teach before moving back to Singapore in 1951. He taught at various schools such as Ai Tong, Chong Fu, Tao Nan and Kong Hwa. He also pioneered student Mandarin drama performances at Chung Cheng High School from 1953 to 1954. In 1955, he was one of the founding members of Mandarin Theatre group, the Singapore Amateur Players (now known as the Arts Theatre of Singapore), and established Singapore’s Hokkien Huay Kuan’s arts and cultural troupes in 1986. He also galvanised the various Mandarin drama groups and staged plays such as Little White Sailing Boat (for the Singapore Festival of Arts) in 1982. In 1990, he received the Literary Appreciation Award from the Singapore Literature Society.
