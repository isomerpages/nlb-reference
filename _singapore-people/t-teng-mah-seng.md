### <u>Introduction</u>

Teng Mah Seng（丁马成） (1915﹘1992) was a musician, lyricist and composer. A father of eight, Teng was born in December 1915 in Fujian Province, China and came to Singapore in 1935. In 1945, he started an import-export business.

Teng’s first song was called The Spring Light. In the 1970s, he organised the first Asian International Nanyin Conference, which sparked a revival of interest in nanyin. He was later apointed the president of the Siong Leng Musical Association.

Teng was hailed as the saviour of nanyin music, an ancient form of Chinese opera music that dates back to the 7th-century Tang Dynasty. Teng is credited not only for reviving nanyin, but also for taking it to greater heights by injecting fresh elements to make it more attractive to contemporary audiences, as well as introducing it to the international arts scene. For his artistic contributions, Teng was awarded the Cultural Medallion for Music in 1988.

Teng passed away in 1992 but left behind a rich legacy. The beautiful tunes of his nanyin songs continue to mesmerise many in Singapore and around the world.
