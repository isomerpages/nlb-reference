### <u>Introduction</u>

Tan Siak Kew (陈锡九; Chen Xijiu) (31 May 1903, Teo Ann, Guangdong, China–5 February 1977, Singapore) was a prominent businessman, nominated member of the Legislative Assembly, president of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, diplomat and philanthropist.

He came to Singapore in 1910 and received an English-language education from St Anthony’s Boys School and then Raffles Institution. However, he did not graduate from the latter as he had to return to China with his ageing father. During the two years Tan spent in China, he studied Chinese classics at a private school.

After returning to Singapore in 1921, Tan worked as a clerk at an insurance firm, Overseas Assurance Corporation (华侨保险公司). An assiduous learner, he took night classes on business at Raffles Institution, and engaged a private tutor for Chinese lessons. As a result, Tan became effectively bilingual – a trait that served him well later in life and business.

In the early 1930s, Tan and two friends set up a produce business known as Buan Lee Seng. By the end of the decade, Tan had become known as a merchant in the pepper and gambier trade. In addition to his produce business, Tan diversified into banking, property and shipping.

In 1937, Tan became a committee member of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and served as its president for two terms in the 1950s (1952–54; 1956–58). Among the other positions he held were: nominated member of the Legislative Assembly (1958–59), chairman of Ngee Ann Kongsi (1965), president of the Chinese Exchange Produce (1948–67), president of the Nanyang University Council (1966–70), honorary chairman of the Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan (1969­–76). He was also at various times a member of public bodies such as the Chinese Advisory Board and the Singapore Harbour Board. Tan was a director and then the chairman of Four Seas Communications Bank (previously named Sze Hai Tong Bank) in the 1960s and ’70s.

In the 1950s, Tan advocated for citizenship rights for China-born Chinese in Singapore, and in 1953 became a founding member of the Nanyang University Council. In 1964, Tan was conferred the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal) by then Yang di-Pertuan Negara Yusof Ishak, in recognition of his contributions to Singapore. Following Singapore’s independence, Tan was appointed as the state’s first ambassador to Thailand in 1966.

In 1951, the City Council named a road in Sennett Estate “Siak Kew Avenue”, as Tan was one of the directors of the company that built the housing estate.
