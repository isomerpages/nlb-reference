### <u>Introduction</u>

Wu Lien Teh (Dr) (1879-1960) was a Penang-born doctor who was known internationally for successfully eradicating a deadly outbreak of the plague in northern China and Manchuria in 1910 and 1920. He was known as a “plague fighter”.

Wu came from a family of five sons and his mother was a Hakka born in Penang, Malaysia. His father was Cantonese and migrated from Taishan, Guangdong Province in China to Penang, where he ran a successful business as a goldsmith. Wu received his early education at the Free School in Penang from 1886 to 1896, where he excelled and won many prizes.  He was known as Gnoh Lean Tuck in school, a name he continued to use during his Cambridge education and career in London hospitals. When he became a qualified doctor, he was registered as G.L. Tuck. In 1896, Wu won the only Queen’s scholarship of that year and left Penang to study medicine as the first medical student of Chinese descent in Cambridge University in England. He returned and took up private practice in Chulia Street, Penang. He was also one of the editors of the Straits Chinese Magazine, together with Song Ong Siang and Lim Boon Keng (Dr), who was the elder brother of his first wife. During this period, he also founded the Anti-Opium Society and engaged in social reforms.

In 1908, Wu was appointed as the vice-director of the Imperial Army Medical College in China to train doctors for the Chinese Army. He chaired the first international scientific conference held in China – the International Plague Conference – in 1911, toward the end of the Manchurian epidemic that he had helped to quell. Following this, the Manchurian Plague Prevention Service was established, with Wu as its head. In 1915, the first Chinese Medical Association was established. Wu was a pioneer in the early modernisation of Chinese medical services and was appointed Chief Technical Expert of the Ministry of Health. He assumed a key role in the early development of China’s western medicine, public health and medical education. In 1916, he was conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) by the University of Hong Kong and, in 1922, he was conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) by St. John’s University in Shanghai. In 1923, Wu became the first Chinese to be invited to Japan as a visiting professor. He was also elected as a Foundation Member of Academia Sinica, as well as a Foreign Member of the Society of Microbiology of USSR in Russia.

Wu returned to Malaya in 1937 where he established his own private clinic and spent the remaining years of his life in Penang and Ipoh. In 1957, he donated his personal book collection of 20,000 volumes to the former Nanyang University. This later became part of the library collection at the National University of Singapore (which was established with the merger of Nanyang University and the University of Singapore). Wu suffered a stroke and passed away in his home in Penang on 21 January 1960.
