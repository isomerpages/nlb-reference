### <u>Introduction</u>

Yeh Chih Yun (叶季允; 1859–1921) was a famous newspaperman and poet. His alias included Ye Ji Yin (叶季隐), Ye Mao Bin (叶懋斌), Yong Weng (永翁), Ting Song Lu Shi Sun (听松庐诗孙). He was born on 21 July, 1859 in the Anhui province, China. He used to live in Guangdong and worked as an editor at the Zhongwai Xinbao (《中外新报》) in Hong Kong.

In 1881, when Lat Pau (《叻报》) was founded in Singapore, he was invited to be the newspaper’s Chief Editor, a position he held for 40 years. The editorials he penned were influential in the Singapore Chinese community. Yeh was also a scholar with many talents, which included seal-carving, playing the zither, penning poems, as well as being skilled in Chinese medicine. He published the Chinese Medical Journal (《医学报》), a weekly journal on modern medicine, on 2 July 1901, and advocated the importance of hygiene. In addition, Yeh was one of the founders of Yeung Ching School (养正学校), and General Chinese Trade Affairs Association (新加坡中华商务总会), the precursor to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (新加坡中华总商会).

Selected poems of Yeh were included in Yongweng Shicun (《永翁诗存》), and he was hailed as one of the most extinguished newspapermen and poets in Singapore. Yeh passed away on 9 September 1921, aged 62.
