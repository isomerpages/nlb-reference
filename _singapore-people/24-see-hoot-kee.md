### <u>Introduction</u>

See Hoot Kee (薛佛记; 1793–1847) was a pioneer in the Hokkien dialect community in Singapore. Born on 28 October 1793 in Malacca, he was the eldest child in the family.

See ran a tin mining business at the Lingle area in Malacca and arrived in Singapore in 1826 to extend his business. He was known for his philanthropic contributions to the Hokkien community in Singapore, and was one of the biggest donors to building funds of schools, temples and cemeteries (such as Heng San Teng \[恒山亭\], previously owned by the Hokkien Huay Kuan, but is now part of the Bukit Brown Cemetery). See had six sons and eleven daughters. He returned to Malacca when he turned 46, and was head of the Cheng Hoon Teng \[青云亭\] until his demise eight years later on 26 September 1847. Cheng Hoon Teng is a Chinese temple practising the three doctrinal systems of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism, and is the oldest functioning temple in Malaysia today.
