### <u>Introduction</u>

Wong Nai Siong (黄乃裳; 1849–1924), also known as Huang Jiu Mei (黄九美) or Huang Mu Hua (黄慕华), was a member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance and editor of Jit Shin Pau, a local newspaper. Born in Fujian, China, Wong came from a poor family where he grew up helping out at his family’s farm. When he was six, he started receiving tuition at home from his uncle and was later able to join a traditional private school where he studied the traditional Chinese syllabus whenever he is not required to work in the field.

In 1895, when Wong was in Beijing for his metropolitan examination, he joined the “Letter to Bus” reform and encountered the Kang You Wei, leader of the 1898 Reform Movement in China. He was conferred the title of fifth-rank official and became involved in the Reform movement, but soon left Beijing to escape persecution after the movement failed to take off.

At the invitation of his son-in-law Lim Boon Keng, an eminent figure of the Chinese Straits community, Wong moved his family to Singapore in 1899 and became the chief editor of Jit Shin Pau. Wong soon left Singapore for Sibu, where he set up the New Foochow Settlement Company and recruited Chinese immigrants to open up the land. However, the company was closed down in 1904.

Wong then dedicated himself to the revolutionary movement and joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance after meeting Sun Yat Sen at Wan Qing Yuan in 1906. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Wong took up several positions in the Chinese government. He retired from his position as Senior Advisor at the Fujian Provincial Office in July 1924 due to a recurrent heart disease. Wong passed away in September 1924, aged 75.
