_Art X Stacks_ is a display of artworks and resources in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library (LKCRL) Levels 8, 9, and 11 reading rooms. A key feature of this display is the convergence of artwork, library, and archival collections, where the visual arts provide new perspectives and entry points into the collections of the National Library (NL) and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS).

Beyond what is highlighted in the reading room displays, this complementary Resource Guide provides an extended selection of related resources from our collections. Corresponding to the _Art X Stacks_ themes, each section in this Resource Guide includes a list of books, _BiblioAsia_ and _Infopedia_ articles. In addition, we shine the spotlight on different special collections in each section to give you a flavour of the diversity of materials in our holdings. We hope that this variety of resources will prompt new ways of understanding Singapore history and culture.

## NATURE

#### BOOKS

Artworks by local artists Earl Lu and Lim Tiong Ghee displayed on Level 8 of the library are examples of how artists have represented their experience of nature in paintings. Artistic interaction can also take on other modes of expression, including land art and photography.

In this section, we will learn more about how nature features in the visual arts, from traditional tropes such as landscape paintings and the still life genre to contemporary art practices such as land art, where the natural world becomes a physical site for artistic creation.
