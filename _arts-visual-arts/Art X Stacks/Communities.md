#### Spotlight: Government Records


Food has endured as a cherished part of community living throughout Singapore’s history, and the places where we buy and consume food have seen many changes, from the street vendors of the past to the hawker centres and food courts today. For the aficionado of hawker food and culture, NAS’ [government records](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/)[^4] is a collection to lose oneself in. For example, you can find out [whether itinerant hawkers were allowed to sell laksa](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/0deaace5-115a-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) along the streets between 1973 and 1983, [how many ice-cream stalls](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/9cc50732-d6cf-11ea-9f50-001a4a5ba61b) there were in the late 1970s, and how [the hawker community made suggestions](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/a8dfd0b0-1159-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) for the management of hawker licenses.

#### Spotlight: Singapore Literary Arts Collection

Migrant communities form an important part of societies around the world today. Their experiences of working and living in a foreign country are sometimes expressed through creative outlets, such as poetry. In this section, we feature NL’s literary arts collection, highlighting a selection of poetry from the migrant communities of Singapore. Through the medium of creative writing, space is created for us to ponder the meanings of “migrant,” “local" and what it means to be part of a community.
