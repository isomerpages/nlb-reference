*Art X Stacks* is a display of artworks and resources in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library (LKCRL) Levels 8, 9 and 11 reading rooms. A key feature of this display is the convergence of artwork, library, and archival collections, where the visual arts provide new perspectives and entry points into the collections of the National Library (NL) and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS).

Beyond what is highlighted in the reading room displays, this complementary Resource Guide provides an extended selection of related resources from our collections. Corresponding to the *Art X Stacks* themes, each section in this Resource Guide includes a list of books[\[1\]](#_ftn1), *BiblioAsia*[\[2\]](#_ftn2) and *Infopedia*[\[3\]](#_ftn3) articles. In addition, we shine the spotlight on different special collections in each section to give you a flavour of the diversity of materials in our holdings. We hope that this variety of resources will prompt new ways of understanding Singapore history and culture.

## NATURE
#### Books <a name="anchor1"></a>
Artworks by local artists Earl Lu and Lim Tiong Ghee displayed on Level 8 of the library are examples of how artists have represented their experience of nature in paintings. Artistic interaction can also take on other modes of expression, including land art and photography.

In this section, we learn more about how nature features in the visual arts, from traditional tropes such as landscape paintings and the still life genre to contemporary art practices such as land art, where the natural world becomes a physical site for artistic creation.

San Francisco: Asian Art Museum, 2017.<br><br>Frequently found as subjects in still life paintings, flowers have deep and varied symbolic connotations in art. From the transcendence represented by a lotus flower to the ephemerality of life represented by cherry blossoms, this volume explores the meanings of six celebrated flowers among the artworks of the Asian Art Museum. |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/still%20life.jpg) | Schneider, Norbert. [*Still Life: Still Life Painting in the Early Modern Period*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=11935586). London: Taschen, 2003.<br><br>Still life is widely taught as part of beginner art courses, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is just a simplistic genre. This book considers the theoretical background of the still life genre, as well as the potential for still life paintings to contain deep symbolic meanings. |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/art%20of%20the%20natural%20world.jpg) | Rosenblum, Richard. [*Art of the Natural World: Resonances of Wild Nature in Chinese Sculptural Art*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=12438565). Boston, Mass.: MFA Publications, 2001.<br><br>Rocks which have been sculpted by natural elements are sometimes considered works of art. Artist and collector Richard Rosenblum contemplates the aspects of such “artworks” and the issues they raise around the intersection of art and natural processes. |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/land%20art%20ben%20tufnell.jpg)| Tufnell, Ben. [*Land Art*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=12974559). London: Tate, 2006.<br><br>Often situated within the natural environment instead of museums and galleries, land art emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as an articulation of the experience of nature and landscape. Characterised by an immediate engagement with natural processes, sometimes uncontrolled, land art also included the deployment of natural objects such as soil and rocks. |
|![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/land%20and%20environmental%20art.jpg) | Kastner, Jeffrey and Brian Wallis. [*Land and Environmental Art: Themes and Movements*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=9363039). London: Phaidon, 1998.<br><br>This title documents the genesis of land art in the 1960s and 1970s, highlighting key works and documents that have influenced discussions on land art. Writings in this compilation also emphasise the importance of creating art within the natural environment, instead of just representing it on the canvas.  |

####  Spotlight: Singapore Visual Arts Collection 

Singapore is commonly regarded as a concrete jungle with a limited natural landscape, but this does not make our experience of nature any less interesting. Drawn from the NL’s visual arts collection, here are some exhibition catalogues and publications by Singapore artists who give us different perspectives of the natural world in this island city.


| Book                                                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/beyondwilderness.jpg) | Chua, Chye Teck. [*Beyond Wilderness*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=202435863). Singapore: Epigram Books, 2016.<br><br>Singapore photographer Chua Chye Teck poetically captures monochromatic images of forests in Singapore, bringing to mind traditional pencil or charcoal drawings. The meditative aspect of his images is an expression of the artist’s reflection on the loss of nature, often due to urban development.  |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/newforest.jpg) | Zhao, Robert. [*New Forest. 1, A History of Cows.*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=205402096). Singapore: Institute of Critical Zoologists, 2020.<br><br>Conceived by multi-disciplinary artist Robert Zhao, New Forest is a series of books “looking at secondary tropical forest ecologies and histories.” The first volume is dedicated to the “last cow” in Singapore, which died on Coney Island, a small land mass in north-eastern Singapore, in 2016. Featuring various historical photographs of cows in Singapore, this book considers our evolving relationship with this domesticated animal over the decades as the island went through various stages of development.   |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/preservednature.jpg) | Yap, Chris. [*Preserved Nature*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=13185405). Singapore: chrisyapphotography, 2006.<br><br>The title of photographer Chris Yap’s book plays on the multiple meanings of “preserved nature,” referring to the act of preservation by photographing natural objects or by creating taxidermies and dried plant arrangements. By capturing such moments using photographic lenses, Yap draws our attention to the ever-changing and evolving natural world around us.  |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/waystotietrees.jpg) | Woong, Soak Teng. [*Ways to Tie Trees*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=203807325). Germany: Steidl Publishers, 2018.<br><br>In this collection of photographs, Singapore artist Woong Soak Teng has elegantly photographed an often-overlooked aspect of trees in urban landscapes. Focusing on how trees have been tied to stakes and other supporting structures, she highlights the ways that nature has been relocated, deployed and curated within built up areas. |
| ![](/images/arts/visualarts/Art%20X%20Stacks/thewordforworldisforest.jpg) | Khairulddin Wahab. [*The Word for World is Forest*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?id=205777786). Singapore: Cuturi Gallery, 2021.<br><br>This catalogue was published on the occasion of the debut solo exhibition of Singapore artist Khairulddin Wahab in 2021. Taking a macro-view of our relationship with the natural world, Khairulddin examines how the land around us has been shaped by various perspectives throughout history such as colonialism and its associated cartographic practices. Khairulddin was also one of the inaugural Creative Residents with the National Library from January to June 2022. A recording of his presentation as a Creative Resident can be found [here](https://nlb.ap.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1e6f7236-3cff-4de5-b7cc-af0100ab6247). |

Singapore: National Gallery Singapore, 2016.<br><br>This catalogue was published in conjunction with *Earth Work 1979*, an exhibition at National Gallery Singapore in 2016. This exhibition revisited Tang’s staging in 1980 featuring installations and mineral pigment works. The original 1980 exhibition was considered one of Singapore’s first exhibition of land art.  |

####  Spotlight: SoundscapeSG

When city-living becomes unbearable in our concrete jungle, perhaps all we need are some sounds from nature. [This collection of sounds](https://www.nas.gov.sg/citizenarchivist/SoundScape/describe?collectionId=198) from nature and wildlife in NAS’ SoundscapeSG may provide some respite for all of us. Just close your eyes and listen to the ambient sounds of the Sungei Buloh Wetland, the call of a yellow-bellied puddle frog, or the munching from otters and their pups to be transported away to nature. 

[SoundscapeSG](https://www.nas.gov.sg/citizenarchivist/SoundScape/describe) aims to create a soundmap of Singapore through the crowdsourcing of sound recordings that are taken in natural settings, to preserve the unique and authentic sounds of Singapore. The collection also includes sounds from daily life, such as festivals and celebrations, arts and dialects. You can also contribute your recordings of sounds that you feel represent Singapore of the past and present.

## COMMUNITIES

The artworks on Level 9 of the library give us a glimpse of life in the past, whether it is *kampong* living or shopping at the street markets. The following resources will shed more light on how various communities made their homes in Singapore and developed different lifestyles and cultural practices. In this section, we will also hear the perspectives of various communities, either through oral history interviews or through songs and poems.

#### Spotlight: National Online Repository of the Arts (NORA)

The performing arts of Singapore have been enriched by the diversity of the  communities who continue to preserve and tell their stories. NL has worked with some of these groups to digitise and make available their arts heritage materials on [NORA](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/arts/website/Common/Homepage.aspx), a database of digitised works in the literary, performing and visual arts by Singapore artists and arts groups. Many of these works were previously unpublished, out-of-print or inaccessible to the masses. Among other materials, this collection includes:

#### Spotlight: Government Records


Food has endured as a cherished part of community living throughout Singapore’s history, and the places where we buy and consume food have seen many changes, from the street vendors of the past to the hawker centres and food courts today. For the aficionado of hawker food and culture, NAS’ [government records](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/)[\[4\]](#_ftn4) is a collection to lose oneself in. For example, you can find out [whether itinerant hawkers were allowed to sell laksa](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/0deaace5-115a-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) along the streets between 1973 and 1983, [how many ice-cream stalls](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/9cc50732-d6cf-11ea-9f50-001a4a5ba61b) there were in the late 1970s, and how [the hawker community made suggestions](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/record-details/a8dfd0b0-1159-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) for the management of hawker licenses.

#### Spotlight: Singapore Literary Arts Collection

Migrant communities form an important part of societies around the world today. Their experiences of working and living in a foreign country are sometimes expressed through creative outlets, such as poetry. In this section, we feature NL’s literary arts collection, highlighting a selection of poetry from the migrant communities of Singapore. Through the medium of creative writing, space is created for us to ponder the meanings of “migrant,” “local" and what it means to be part of a community.

## PLACES

In this section, we delve deeper into the history of the places portrayed in the artworks on Level 11 of the library. The following resources tell us more about the transformation of the Singapore River, the community memories associated with Chinatown, and bring us back in time to the opening of the former National Stadium in 1973. As we reflect on these stories, we can revisit the paintings and the physical sites with fresh perspectives.

#### Spotlight: Map Collections

Even though the geographical location of the Singapore River and Chinatown have not shifted over the years, buildings and roads in these areas have seen many changes in urban development. One of the most engaging ways to study these changes is the use of geo-reference maps, which are images associated with at least one or more coordinates so that they can be overlaid on top of street or satellite maps. NLB’s [Spatial Discovery](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery) is a one-stop platform for users to explore, find and interact with maps across the NAS[\[5\]](#_ftn5) and NL[\[6\]](#_ftn6) collections. Story maps of [Chinatown](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery/storymaps/chinatown-landmarks/index.html) and the [Heritage Bridges of Singapore](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery/storymaps/bridges-of-singapore-river-1966/index.html) are also available on the Spatial Discovery platform.

#### Spotlight: Photographs

Photographs are often considered documentary in nature, but they can also offer us more intimate views of the cityscape, especially scenes which may no longer exist.
