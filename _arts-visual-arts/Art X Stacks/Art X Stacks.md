*Art X Stacks* is a display of artworks and resources in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library (LKCRL) Levels 8, 9 and 11 reading rooms. A key feature of this display is the convergence of artwork, library, and archival collections, where the visual arts provide new perspectives and entry points into the collections of the National Library (NL) and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS).

Beyond what is highlighted in the reading room displays, this complementary Resource Guide provides an extended selection of related resources from our collections. Corresponding to the *Art X Stacks* themes, each section in this Resource Guide includes a list of books[^1], *BiblioAsia*[^2] and *Infopedia*[^3] articles. In addition, we shine the spotlight on different special collections in each section to give you a flavour of the diversity of materials in our holdings. We hope that this variety of resources will prompt new ways of understanding Singapore history and culture.
