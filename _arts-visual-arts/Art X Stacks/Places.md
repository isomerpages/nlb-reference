# Art X Stacks - Places

In this section, we delve deeper into the history of the places portrayed in the artworks on Level 11 of the library. The following resources tell us more about the transformation of the Singapore River, the community memories associated with Chinatown, and bring us back in time to the opening of the former National Stadium in 1973. As we reflect on these stories, we can revisit the paintings and the physical sites with fresh perspectives.

#### Spotlight: Map Collections

Even though the geographical location of the Singapore River and Chinatown have not shifted over the years, buildings and roads in these areas have seen many changes in urban development. One of the most engaging ways to study these changes is the use of geo-reference maps, which are images associated with at least one or more coordinates so that they can be overlaid on top of street or satellite maps. NLB’s [Spatial Discovery](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery) is a one-stop platform for users to explore, find and interact with maps across the NAS[^5] and NL[^6] collections. Story maps of [Chinatown](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery/storymaps/chinatown-landmarks/index.html) and the [Heritage Bridges of Singapore](https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery/storymaps/bridges-of-singapore-river-1966/index.html) are also available on the Spatial Discovery platform.

#### Spotlight: MusicSG


After watching the National Day Parade, you may be inspired to belt out some beloved National Day songs in the privacy of your home. NL’s MusicSG collection will equip you with lyrics, scores and histories of these songs. MusicSG is an archive set up to digitise, archive and provide access to all forms of Singapore musical works. It assembles a collection of music composed or published by Singaporeans, music produced or published in Singapore, and music related to Singapore.

Read [an article on the National Day songs](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/music/opencmscontent.aspx?id=c6b02ce4-985b-4ecd-bc50-2f2af521fe75) before listening to a [medley](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/music/music/track/7892323f-fffe-4353-aaf4-f9077d489c61), including [_Stand up for Singapore_](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/music/music/track/959a82ef-f618-483b-8b26-9dbb51a59444), one of Singapore’s first National Day songs composed by Hugh Harrison in 1984.

[^5]: The NAS database holds maps and building plans, the bulk of which were transferred from government bodies over the years. These maps, including topographic maps, survey maps, general maps, aviation maps and hydrographic charts, record the changing Singapore landscape throughout history. The building plans in the database are dated from before 1946 and are those of private properties.

[^6]: The NL collection forms part of the valuable Rare Materials Collection. It contains topographic maps and navigational charts covering Singapore, Southeast Asia and Asia, as well as town plans and street maps of Singapore and Malaya. The majority of these maps were printed by European map-makers before 1945. These maps illustrate the development of European mapping of early Southeast Asia, as well as the history of the region.
