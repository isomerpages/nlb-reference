### <u>Introduction</u>

**About NORA**

This resource guide highlights selected artworks and artists available on the National Library portal, NORA (National Online Repository of the Arts). NORA aims to showcase Singapore arts heritage and is a database of digitised works in the literary, visual, performing and traditional arts. Some of these works may be unpublished, out-of-print or inaccessible. The collection in NORA includes interviews, photos, manuscripts, scores, resource guides, articles and more on prominent Singaporean artists as well as Cultural Medallion Recipients (CMRs).

As part of Singapore’s digital heritage collection, NORA serves as a source of reference for anyone interested in Singapore arts. NORA can be easily accessed from home or the multimedia stations available at all National Library Board libraries. For more information, visit http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/arts

The NORA collection of artworks range from ink to oil paintings, ceramic to metal sculptures and images of landscapes to the abstract. Created by Singaporean artists from the mid-20th to 21st century, these provide a brief visual introduction to the development of the Singapore art scene. Video interviews with Cultural Medallion Recipients and Young Artist Award Recipients provide insights to the creative processes, inspiration and challenges of being an artist in Singapore.
