**The Arts Space at Level 8 of the National Library has been re-imagined as a space that brings to life our rich collection from books and photographs to artworks and poems. Inspired by the painting, “The Couple” by acclaimed Singapore artist Tan Swie Hian, the Arts librarians have set out to create a multi-purpose space – physical and virtual, collaborative and contemplative – that not only evokes a cosy reading corner with recommended reads but a curated space for displays and exhibitions.**

Impressions of Nature marks season two of the Arts Space thematic display of paintings from our collection. Having explored Singapore’s built streetscapes in the first season, we return to nature through three trails: Across the Lands, For the Love of Flora and Second Nature. Explore the beauty and moments in nature as captured by artists, poets and performers this season, from Nov 2018 to April 2019 at the Arts Space @ Level 8. Read on to find out more and to discover home-grown paintings, artists, poems and a host of other resources.

With imperial expansion, growth of scientific and anthropological research as well as expeditions, there was a rise in visual documentation of distant lands. In addition to early photographs, European or colonial perceptions of 19th century Southeast Asian landscapes can also be found in sketches, scientific illustrations and paintings.

Artistic representations of such “faraway places” were commonplace in establishing idyllic visions of imperial landscapes back in their home country. With Singapore functioning as a port of call in the 19th century, many travellers visited the colony, capturing their impressions in writing, prints and painting. On display are a selection of prints which include printmaking methods such as engraving, etching, aquatints and lithography.

 

**About the printmakers**

Amongst the different types of printmakers, lithographers also played an important role in reproducing artistic impressions in books for wider distribution and recording. Vincent Brooks, Hullmandel & Walton, and Ackermann & Co. were some of the famous firms in Paris and London that lithographed, published and printed prints of Singapore. Ackermann & Co., for instance, was the leading publisher of colour-plate books and decorative prints, selling compilations and illustrations for accompanying publications at its shop, The Repository of Arts in London.

Another important figure in the development of British lithography was Charles Joseph Hullmandel (of Hullmandel & Walton) who patented the method of printing tonal effects drawn on stone. Lithographers either worked with artists or were artists themselves, like French lithographers Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bayot and Leon Jean-Baptiste Sabatier who had worked with Louis Le Breton (1818 – 1866), a distinguished maritime artist, to reproduce his 1839 Rade de Sincapour, prise de la maison du Gouverneur (Malaisie). Charles-Nicolas Lemercier (1797 – 1859), who did the printing of this lithograph was a painter of historical scenes and landscapes and also collaborated with other artists like Barthélemy Lauvergne (1805 – 1871), a French marine painter who came to Singapore on a French expedition in 1830. Other examples of lithographers who produced prints on Singapore are Eugen von Ransonnet, J. West Giles, William Spreat and G.S. Madelay.

The beauty of flora has inspired poets, composers and artists across the ages. Flowers blossomed into one of the most popular subject matter for the visual arts. This is evident from depictions of botanical elements in ancient art such as Egyptian ceramic-ware, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings through to the contemporary art of today.

A familiar sight in our garden city’s landscape is the bougainvillea: a popular tropical and sub-tropical ornamental flower that adorns Singapore’s roads and overhead bridges. The common colours of the flowers are magenta or purple, while other hues include pure white to rich crimson. On display are paintings which celebrate the vivid hues of tropical flora by Singapore artists, Eng Tow and Lim Tiong Ghee.

 

### About the artists

Eng Tow (1947 – )
Eng Tow (b. 1947, Singapore) is noted as one of Singapore’s most outstanding local female artists of the 1980s. Her early career which revolved around textiles won her critical acclaim in the United Kingdom and Singapore. She first studied art at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and then headed to England for further studies. Eng began her artistic career working on textile art before moving to mixed media collage, paper pulp work and more recently to bronze-cast sculptures. Eng Tow has a personal interest and passion for nature, which is reflected in her works.

Lim Tiong Ghee (1955 – )
A self-taught artist renowned for his signature abstracts and collages, Lim Tiong Ghee (b. 1955, Singapore), prefers abstraction in his portrayal of landscapes and tropical flowers. He has painted numerous landscapes since the 1970s. In his Tropical Plant series, the growth of plants is re-created on canvas. Aside from collages, Lim has also worked with mixed-media and watercolour. He has won several accolades for his works, including the Category Winner (Representational), UOB Painting of the Year Competition in 1984 with his watercolour painting Reflection, and UOB Competition’s Top Award for his wrapping paper collage, From the Turtledove, in 1989.

Artists make the invisible visible through their impressions of nature, capturing movements and colours of the natural world. Using nature as a source of inspiration, abstract works of art offer interpretations and revelations of nature’s structures and colours. Abstract art, or non-objective art, tends to be non-representational, with form and colour being the focus of such art works. The semi-abstract works displayed have their basis in natural forms such as the lalang or the leaves from a tree, simplifying them, “without destroying their identities”. The quiet nature of the wind runs through these artworks, captured by the movement of bold strokes by the artists.

 

### About the artists

Lim Tiong Ghee (1955 – )
A self-taught artist renowned for his signature abstracts and collages, Lim Tiong Ghee (b. 1955, Singapore), prefers abstraction in his portrayal of landscapes and tropical flowers. He has painted numerous landscapes since the 1970s. His Seabreeze series of 10 artworks capture the different moods of the sea and land.

Abdul Ghani Hamid (1933 – 2014)
Abdul Ghani Abdul Hamid (b. 1933, Singapore – d. 2014, Singapore) was an award-winning writer, poet and artist. Writing primarily in Malay, A. Ghani Hamid, as he was commonly known, had hundreds of poems, short stories, essays, newspaper articles and plays to his name. As a painter, he participated in more than 60 exhibitions since 1950. He was a founding member of Angkatan Pelukis Aneka Daya (APAD, or Artists of Various Resources) and the recipient of three prestigious literary awards: Anugerah Tun Seri Lanang (1998), Southeast Asia Write Award for Malay Poetry (1998) and the Cultural Medallion (1999). In 1978, his collection of poems, written between 1973 and 1978, was translated into English and published under the title, Breezes. Continuing with this nature-inspired theme, his fifth solo exhibition was titled Breeze ’89, while his sixth solo exhibition was named Breeze 2000. His series of abstract paintings, Lalang, were the most famous in his body of work.

Prabhakara Jimmy Quek (1955 – )
Prabhakara Jimmy Quek (b. 1955, Singapore), is an artist known for his keen interest in spirituality, with Buddhist tenets greatly influencing his works. Notions of change, impermanence and inter-relational nature of things are often reflected in his paintings. He signs his paintings with “Prabhakara”, the Sanskrit word for ‘source of light’. He has held 11 one-man art exhibitions and participated in more than 80 group art exhibitions in Singapore and abroad. Quek’s earlier works depicted nature in “its wild and picturesque state”. Beginning to Rejoice and Celebrating with Nature are two of his best-known works from this earlier period. While Quek is an abstract painter, he uses figures to create colour, form, line, composition, texture and shades. He has won numerous awards for his art, such as the third prize in the National Art Competition (1974) and the first and merit prize in the IBM Art Award competition (1988).
