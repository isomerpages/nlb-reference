**The Arts Space at Level 8 at the National Library has been re-imagined as a space that brings to life our rich collection from books and photographs to artworks and poems. Inspired by the painting, “The Couple” by acclaimed Singapore artist Tan Swie Hian, the Arts Librarians have set out to create a multi-purpose space – physical and virtual, collaborative and contemplative – that not only evokes a cosy reading corner with recommended reads but a curated space for displays and exhibitions.**

Welcome to Season 3 of The Arts Space – Makan-Makan. Food is essential to life – from eating for survival to indulging in the pleasures of food. As the local saying goes, “we do not eat to live – we live to eat”! Eating is both Singapore’s favourite past time and an integral part of our culture. In attempts to express the essence of our gastronomic experiences, food has been depicted across many art mediums, ranging from still life to literature to film. Come join us at the National Library this season as we explore food and its part in our everyday lives as captured by artists, writers and filmmakers.

First to the lively wet markets then to the kitchen! Getting food on the table starts from the laborious process of washing, cutting, seasoning and eventually cooking. Trace the finer details of food preparation with Poh Siew Wah’s On the Floor and Soh Chee Hui’s Pomegranate, Teapot with Cup, and catch glimpses of our local wet market culture in Chua Mia Tee’s Fishmonger.

 

<b><u>About the artists</u></b>

**Chua Mia Tee (1931 – )**

Chua Mia Tee is a prominent artist in Singapore, best known for his portrayals of Singapore’s vanishing landscapes and realistic paintings. Capturing socio-historical moments of the nation, Epic Poem of Malaya (1955), National Language Class (1959) and Works in the Canteen (1974) are some of Chua’s often-cited and discussed works. Chua’s depictions of Singapore’s landscapes and ways of life that were fast disappearing due to urbanisation are important records of Singapore’s history. Working primarily with oil, Chua has also used other mediums such as acrylic, watercolour, bronze and relief. He was conferred the Cultural Medallion Award in 2015 in recognition of his artistic contributions to Singapore.

**Soh Chee Hui (1967 – )**

Soh Chee Hui received his art education at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and the University of Birmingham. He was also the recipient of the UOB Painting of the Year award in 1992. Influenced by both Chinese and Western artistic traditions, Soh’s works juxtapose motifs from different cultures, prompting new ways of understanding them. For instance, Soh’s paintings frequently feature fruits, and while they can be read along the paradigm of Western still life, their arrangement and patterns on the bowl bring a local flavour to the viewing experience. Soh delights in uncovering such complexities in seemingly simple items. The pomegranate has been of particular interest to him since he discovered that it symbolises abundance in Chinese societies and sexuality in the West. One of his paintings displayed here features a pomegranate alongside other household objects.

**Poh Siew Wah (1948 – )**

Poh Siew Wah is a professional artist, art educator and stamp designer. A notable second generation Singapore artist, Poh is known for his abstract paintings inspired by Singapore and Southeast Asia. Aside from landscapes, his art also captures street scenes and figures. His commissioned artwork at Farrer Park MRT station, titled Rhythmic Exuberance, includes both figurative drawings and abstract expressions of sports. He also works in a myriad of mediums, including Chinese ink, watercolour and oil. Poh has won several accolades for his work, such as the NAFA Alumni Distinction in Creative Art Award (1984, 1987, 1988) and the Singapore Art Society’s Tan Tze Chor Award (2010).

As a multicultural society, Singapore has a rich food heritage that speaks of a fusion of diverse cultures. Be it a piping hot bowl of laksa enjoyed at the hawker centre or kopitiam, or kacang puteh at a roadside food stall, there is something quintessentially Singaporean about seeking out culinary treasures from all corners of the island. The origins of our hawker culture can be traced all the way to the 1800s when travelling hawkers peddling food and drinks were common sights on the streets of Singapore. Through the works of artists such as Chua Mia Tee and Poh Siew Wah, we can venture back in time to visit the hawkers of the past and catch a glimpse of Singapore’s early street food culture.

**Andrew Yeo (1964 – )**

Andrew Yeo is a Singapore artist whose practice spans several mediums such as watercolour, oil, pastel and acrylic mixed media. Yeo sees painting as a way to preserve memories of Singapore’s landscape, shop houses, street scenes and vanishing trades. Although his works may seem documentary in nature, the scenes he depicts are often places he visited or memories from his childhood. What he seeks to portray are not straightforward snapshots, but the sense of nostalgia associated with these scenes, some of which have already disappeared. In Johore Road, Yeo captures a bustling street that was famous for its street hawkers and wholesalers. Johore Road was located near the site of the current National Library building, but no longer exists today.

**Loy Chye Chuan (1940 – )**

A self-taught painter, Loy Chye Chuan started painting in 1958. He gained recognition as a watercolour artist by learning from other renowned practitioners such as Lim Cheng Hoe in the 1960s. Eventually developing his own style, Loy’s works include landscape scenery and street scenes of an older Singapore, where he used bright colours to inject a fresh and lively feel. Loy is one of the 13 founding members of the Singapore Watercolour Society, which was established on 18 August 1969.

Horror, revulsion, then intrigue, fascination, and even an odd sense of pleasure – these emotions fill us when we encounter cannibalism in literature and film. The cannibal is simply pervasive in popular culture. Through the chronological study of the transgressing cannibal figure across different genres, Brown is able to provide us with insights into the accepted norms, prejudices, taboos and very real fears a society harbours, especially pertinent to all of us living in a modern era of consumerism and overindulgence.

Who would have known that something as innocuous as a mango was once a key vehicle for important political propaganda in China? During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the golden mango was a potent symbol of the power and respect Chairman Mao accorded to the working class. It signified an important power shift to the proletariat which became the main force of order and stability amongst the chaos. In the chapter Political Awakening through the Magical Fruit: The Film Song of the Mango, Adam Yuet Chau discusses the central element of the mango in the 1976 film Song of the Mango situated in its political context.
