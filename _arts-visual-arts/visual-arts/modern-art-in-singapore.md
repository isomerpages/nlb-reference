### <u>Introduction</u>

Since the nineteenth century, the definition of the ‘modern’ itself has been debated in Western art-historical and scholarly discourse. This has certainly been no less true in Singapore and Asia at large, where what ‘modern’ and ‘modernism’ refer to are further complicated by larger issues such as the history of European colonialism, the emergence of the nation-state as a new mode of structuring the world, postcolonial awareness, and so on. In short, ‘modernism’ and the ‘modern’ remain complex and contentious, particularly so in the Asian continent. Indeed, as Low Sze Wee and Shabbir Mustafa tell us, curators and art practitioners have intensely debated about “the topic of ‘modernism’ in Singapore, ranging from what definitions, terminologies, and technologies one may adopt to whether there is a specific story to be narrated about the ‘modern’ in Singapore”. [^1]

Twentieth-century modern(ist) art in Singapore was mainly concerned with imagining the ‘local’ and asserting an indigenous identity through aesthetic material that distinctively represents Singapore and the region, such as the Singapore River or even native produce like tropical fruits. This distinguished modernist Singaporean art from Western High modernist art. One of the defining schools or movements of modernist Singaporean art was the Nanyang Style championed by Nanyang Academy of the Fine Arts (NAFA) practitioners (the ‘Nanyang Artists’), which flourished during the 1950s. These artists synthesized the many aesthetic traditions they were formally trained in—from Chinese/East Asian art to the School of Paris—to produce an artistic canon that is clearly Singaporean. Elsewhere, Chinese ink and calligraphic artists such as Chua Ek Kay and Lim Tze Peng also reinvented the practice, reshaping it as a uniquely local tradition. A similar phenomenon occurred with regard to watercolour painting by artists such as Chen Chong Swee.

The ‘localization’ of the modern was further enriched by several key events and conditions, one of which was the historic 1952 Bali field trip undertaken by pioneer artists Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, and Cheong Soo Pieng, who aspired to recruit Bali as a rich visual resource. Unlike the way in which Euro-American artists approached the ‘East’ as an exotic and foreign Oriental space, these Singaporean artists had a much more nuanced and complicated relationship with Indonesia, our regional neighbour—for them, Bali was not simply a land of exotica, but also one that they personally identified with as part of Nanyang Culture. It has also been noted that at least during the mid-twentieth century, modernist Singaporean art was dominated by Chinese artists at the expense of ethnic minority individuals, which summoned issues of ethnic representation and Singaporean multiculturalism that do not appear in discussions of the ‘modern’ and ‘modernism’ elsewhere in the world.

To construct some parameters for this resource guide, we define ‘modern Singaporean art’ as chiefly fine/visual art produced during late-nineteenth century and twentieth century Singapore. However, given the range of meanings and associations that can be ascribed to the ‘modern’ across different spaces and different periods, we also use the term here as an inadvertently open-ended frame of reference; as such, we also include further resources on Singaporean art from before and after this time period to demonstrate that modern Singaporean art can be located within a larger historical continuum, and that the distinctions between the ‘pre-modern,’ ‘modern,’ ‘post-modern’ and ‘contemporary’ can occasionally be blurred.

This guide provides resources for those who are keen to know more about Modern Art in Singapore. You can also visit[ catalogue.nlb.gov.sg](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/) to search for more resources. This resource guide was first authored and updated by Roberta Balagopal and Jason Yan. It was last updated in August 2021 by Nadia Ramli, an Associate Librarian at the National Library, Singapore.

            The might of curators and auctioneers to partially determine the development, prominence, and canonization of an art-world cannot be underestimated, and such is the case in Singaporean art as well. This auction catalog by 33 Auction, wherein some 70-odd works by Singaporean artists in different media and composed over multiple points in art history in different styles, signify as a microcosm of the development of modern Singapore art. Each work, reproduced here in full colour, is accompanied by an informative caption.

       Exhibition catalog for the 1990 Enterprise & Art Foundation-organized exhibition, entitled Modern Art Travels East-West, endorsed by the Singaporean and Dutch governments, wherein more than 100 modern artworks from each country were juxtaposed insofar as a comparative approach to global/local modernism(s) is facilitated. The mounted works in question are reproduced as full-colour plates here; the Singaporean section offered seminal works by key modern artists, such as Chen Wen Hsi’s Chinese-ink-inspired Gibbons II (c1970) and Ken Quek’s abstract geometric Kite (Series No. 13) (1987). Constance Sheare’s essay, “Modern Singaporean Painting: An Introduction” proves instructive in elaborating modern Singaporean art and can be read as a counterpoint and in connection to Liesbeth Hemelrijk’s “Modern Painting in the Netherlands: An Introduction.”

Multiple photographs of modern Malayan artists and colour reproductions of their seminal works are included, e.g. Cheong Soo Pieng’s Pounding Rice (1953) and Chia Yu Chian’s Golden Pagoda (1958).

T K Sabapathy’s introduction instructively proffers heterogeneous ways to read and access works in the exhibition with reference to the multiple articulations of local(ized) modernities; as he discloses, modernism frustrates the compulsion to “construct [a] continuous, unified, seamless narrative… [that] provides wholesome satisfaction.” Colour plate reproductions of all the works exhibited are included.

    Published to commemorate the opening of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), this text obtains as the “first foray into investigating and making meaning of the development of modern art in Southeast Asia from the perspective of insiders,” as its blurb discloses. The essays, which variously consider Malaysian art history, modern Thai art’s co-option of traditionalism, and so on, provides a sound framework to consider expressions of ‘modernity’ in Singaporean art through a regional aesthetics. The exhibited works from Singapore and the region are reproduced as full-color plates, and structured according to thematic concerns such as “The Self and the Other” and “Nationalism, Revolution, and the Idea of the Modern,” tropes dominant in Southeast Asian modernism.

     Extended from a lecture by respected local art historian T K Sabapathy, this is an instructive examination of the representations and coming-into-being of the ‘modern’ in Singaporean and regional art through the development and decline of art history, research, and education in the nation. As an interestingly and deeply personal account that references Sabapathy’s transcontinental career and travels, it connects modern Singaporean art to a larger transnational politics and calls attention to how the canon is also imparted by wider, global conditions.

Several commissioned works by artists such as Gustavo Romano and Handiwirman Saputra were exhibited in (reclaimed) white-cube spaces at City Hall and Tanglin Camp, a practice that recalls High Modernist art.

This essay undertakes a historical approach with respect to the development of Singaporean art and culture from separation to the advent of the new millennium to excavate and illuminate the intersections between art and the nation-state’s ideological/political imperatives; it examines the ways in which art has been co-opted as a statecraft instrument in its own right by government in defining and directing both its citizenry and its collective/national selfhood.

A retrospective and self-reflexive contemplation by Kevin Chua on convening a Sotheby’s course on modern and contemporary Southeast Asian art. Chua asserts the value of reading Southeast Asian modernist and post-modernist expressions as an ideologically-charged counterpoint, considers means to reconcile and/or disarticulate the relationship between the modern(ist) and the contemporary, and endeavours to formulate productive pedagogical practices in the teaching of art.

Kee examines at length the trope of hollowness—which she distinguishes from its apparent cognates such as emptiness—that she argues characterizes modern Singaporean art, reading and appraising the ways in which this motif has been encoded in several key works such as Lee Wen’s World Class (1999) and Amanda Heng’s Let’s Walk (1999). She proceeds to consider the possibilities and implications engendered by this preoccupation with hollowness for a collective/national selfhood as expressed in art, and so on.

This paper considers the implications of socio-economic, historical, and political conditions on postcolonial Malaya’s cultural life and artistic development in the interim, interstitial period between the collapse of British imperialism and the formation of the Malaysian and Singaporean nation-states, arguing that art of that period can be located within the exigencies of modern(ist) nation-state formation.

Taylor considers the absence of a coherent or unified identity in Southeast Asian art on the international exhibition and gallery circuit to gesture toward the ontological fluidity of geopolitical and artistic delineations such as nationality and modernity. Artists referenced include Cambodian artists Sopheap Pich and Vandy Rattana, Burmese artist Chaw Ei Thein and the second Singapore Bienniale exhibit, and the travelling exhibition entitled A Winding River that represents 100 Vietnamese works.
