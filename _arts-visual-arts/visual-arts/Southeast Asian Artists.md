Hendra Gunawan, *Ibu dan Anak Anak.* (1980). [Courtesy of Artnet Auctions](https://www.artnet.com/auctions/artists/hendra-gunawan/ibu-dan-anak-anak).

Southeast Asia as a field of area study only became established in the early 1950s, in the aftermath of World War II. [^1]  It was part of an initiative by American universities and foundations to further understand territories that were once colonised, including countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. While Southeast Asian governments primarily focused on economic development post-World War II, Southeast Asian art only became subject to academic and scholarly scrutiny in the early 1990s. [^2] [^3]

Contemporary Southeast Asian art is often viewed through the lens of colonialism and its aftermath. Art historian John Clark considers the transition to modernity in Southeast Asian art to be conceived in terms of “transfer and domination of Euramerican stylistic models”. [^4] This can be first observed through Raden Saleh’s romantic, Dutch-influenced paintings of Javanese landscapes. As one of the earliest contemporary Southeast Asian artists, Saleh moved out of Java in 1829 to pursue a European art education and quickly gained recognition for his work amongst European aristocracy. During this period, Southeast Asian art was strongly linked to aristocracy-commissioned work, where artists such as Thai painter Khrua In Khong and Filipino native Simon Flores also received their start. [^5]

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, colonisation throughout Southeast Asia brought about the establishment of local fine art academies. In Vietnam, people were urged to accept and understand Western culture with the goal of restoring national independence, especially after many failed uprisings against the French.[^6]  The first fine art academy, L’Ecole des Beaux-arts de L’Indochine, produced artists such as To Ngoc Van and Nguyen Tuong Lan. Similarly, the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura of the Philippines taught Spanish art pedagogy, where prominent Filipino artist Juan Luan studied in the late 1800s. [^7]

During this period, resistance against colonisation manifested in different forms throughout the various Southeast Asian countries. Works by Indonesian artists Soedjojono, Affandi, and Hendra Gunawan often display highly emotional, dominant themes of struggle for independence, poverty, and injustice in the first half of the 20th century. [^8] Likewise, although Filipino artist Victorio C. Edades was largely American trained, the “Father of Modern Philippine Painting” often portrayed rural Filipino labourers and factory workers in his works.

By the 1960s, many Southeast Asian countries increasingly welcomed international trade and oriented themselves toward economic development. [^9] Contemporary Indonesian artists such as Dede Eri Supria and Sudarisman were captivated by the influx of advertisements, graphic design, and photographs. [^10] Photographic realism in painting emerged and flourished in this period, depicting themes that dealt with modern urban life. 

As the contemporary art movement grew in Southeast Asia, more artists moved away from painting to explore different art mediums. In the early 1990s, Thai artists began moving towards a fully collaborative approach by displaying their work in public spaces and encouraging the audience to physically engage with their art.[^11]  Artists such as Montien Boonma and Rirkrit Tiravanija began working with installations and performances, which art historian Sandra Cate identifies as an acknowledgment of art’s historical role as a part of everyday life in Southeast Asia. [^12]

Till this day, the study of contemporary Southeast Asian art remains highly debatable, with various approaches offered by different academics and experts. Nonetheless, contemporary Southeast Asian art continues to evolve and develop today, providing clues that reveal the region’s heritage, history, and development.

Taylor, N. A. (2011). [Art without History? Southeast Asian Artists and Their Communities in the Face of Geography.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41430719) *Art Journal, 70*(2), 6-23.

* Taylor, a professor of South and Southeast Asian art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, explores how Southeast Asian artists have begun to move beyond the opposition of East versus West and instead, are engaging in interregional conversations regarding art. This journal article considers the “Southeast Asian” identity in the context of contemporary art and geographic region.

Cohen, M. I. (2014). [Introduction: Global Encounters in Southeast Asian Performing Arts.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187430) *Asian Theatre Journal, 31*(2), 353-368.

* As Southeast Asian art becomes increasingly recognised, Cohen posits that Southeast Asian theatre and performance are no longer regarded as Western art’s exotic “Other”, or as a tool for nation building. Instead, this journal article discusses contemporary Southeast Asian art’s role in drawing people into conversations surrounding local and global issues.

* Kee challenges current conceptions of modernity and contemporary art through the lens of Southeast Asia, exploring the complexities and nuances in studying this subject. The author dives into how art from this region can be understood and interpreted from various angles, such as geography, religion, language, and events.

* Clarke explores the relationship between stakeholders in the Western art and Asian art communities, diving into how this relationship has changed and evolved, and how that has influenced the way Asian art is perceived and created. The author offers several perspectives to consider when examining and understanding Asian art, including the lack of Asian art scholars, an examination of Asian art textbooks, and the significance of local context.

Chua, K. (2011). On Teaching Modern and Contemporary Southeast Asian Art. *Third Text, 25*(4), 467-473.

* This journal article reflects on Chua’s experience teaching at Sotheby’s Institute, Singapore. The author explores key pedagogical and methodological issues, such as teaching modern and contemporary Southeast Asian art in tandem with Euro-American art, and the value of using aesthetic judgment in teaching this subject area. Chua attempts to offer solutions to these issues, advocating for a theory-plus-practice, historical-and-contemporary approach to teaching regional art.

* Taylor takes a close look at artistic exchanges from the Southeast Asian region in the form of performance art events, re-enactments, and large travelling exhibitions, positing that close physical contact and creative collaboration have allowed for the writing of alternative art histories that rely on oral transmission and live recordings.

* This article considers the art practice of two Southeast Asian artists – Amron Omar, one of Malaysia’s most well-known figurative artists, and Melati Suryodarmo, an Indonesian-born performance artist who has gained international prominence. Both artists explore the body and the self in their work, and this article offers an alternative art historical approach in the comparisons of Southeast Asian art.
