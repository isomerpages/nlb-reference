<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p>Many recognise Liu Kang’s <em><a href="https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1032028" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Artist and Model</a></em> (1954)
as depicting a Balinese scene from the 1952 artists’ trip to Bali, Indonesia.
However, later research reveals that it was based on sketches of Chen Wen
Hsi in Tretes, Java, just before reaching Bali. The seven-week journey,
undertaken by four pioneering artists <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=5ffd9a55-8078-4df8-9652-ffc63a0ea2fe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Liu Kang</a>,
<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=16b5ac02-1b38-4f9a-af00-788859dda380" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chen Chong Swee</a>, <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=3ad34665-6a27-4338-b315-5ff52fbd26a7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chen Wen Hsi</a>,
and <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=7fdd5af9-2143-4874-84d4-70b2c55c0f3c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cheong Soo Pieng</a>,
spanned Jakarta to Bali and culminated in a landmark 1953 exhibition in
Singapore. Despite the trip’s significance in Singapore’s art history,
few details were known about it—until Liu Kang’s family uncovered over
1,000 photographs from the trip.</p>
<p>Though differing in temperament and artistic style, the artists shared
a formative education at Shanghai’s Xinhua Art Academy. Their bond deepened
in 1950s Singapore, culminating in a 1951 group exhibition that showcased
89 works and set record sales, cementing their collective presence in the
local art scene. Their first joint exhibition drew strong public interest
and record sales. Hailed as a milestone for Singapore art, it showcased
Chinese artists' high standards and their role in shaping a distinct Malayan
art through bold experimentation and new stylistic approaches.</p>
