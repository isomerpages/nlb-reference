**The Arts Space at Level 8 of the National Library has been re-imagined as a space that brings to life our rich collection from books and photographs to artworks and poems. Inspired by the painting, “The Couple” by acclaimed Singapore artist Tan Swie Hian, the Arts librarians have set out to create a multi-purpose space – physical and virtual, collaborative and contemplative – that not only evokes a cosy reading corner with recommended reads but a curated space for displays and exhibitions.**


![Overview Image](/images/arts/visualarts/V2_OVERVIEW.png)


Season 1, **_JALAN-JALAN_** (a Malay word meaning to stroll or go for a walk), kicks-off from end-April 2018 through to mid-November 2018. We have curated a thematic display with paintings by Singapore artists in our collection setting the scene and which have been put up throughout Level 8. Encompassing these artworks are resources which are on display within the Arts Space with more available online through this resource guide.

Why **_JALAN-JALAN_**? We want to take you on a journey to revisit some of Singapore’s old buildings and street scenes as depicted by the paintings through three different trails (sub-themes) – Soul City, Ann Siang Revisited and Shop the Past. Read on to find out more and to discover home-grown paintings, artists, poems and a host of other resources.

Cityscape artworks are rich emblems of public memory and private recollections. Juxtaposed alongside city literature by Singapore writers, they fill unspoken spaces in the collective memory of its citizens and mirror the transformations in our cultural geography as we shape-shift to become a ‘smart city’.

This series of paintings form a visual narrative of Singapore’s growth story seen through landmarks located along the Civic District including Cavenagh Bridge, the Padang, the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) chapel (now CHIJMES Hall) and the old National Library Building at Stamford Road.

The nation’s quest for constant re-invention is exemplified by poet Edwin Thumboo’s twin library poems “The National Library, nr Dhoby Ghaut, Singapore” and “National Library, 2007, Bugis” which feature the old and new libraries respectively and articulate an ongoing pursuit of knowledge amid calls for innovation. The sleek contours of the current National Library building pay tribute to the virtues of “life-long learning” in a digital era.

Tong graduated from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) in 1960 and was a part-time lecturer in Western Art at NAFA from 1995-2010. He was the winner of the Tan Tsze Chor Art Award in 1992 and represented Singapore at the 1998 Flemish Watercolour Days in Zaventum, Europe.

![annsiang](/images/arts/visualarts/Ann-Siang-Revisitedv3.jpg)

Ann Siang Road located in the historic Telok Ayer District in Chinatown begins from a road known as Ann Siang Hill and connects to Kadayanallur Street. It is named after Chia Ann Siang (1832‒1892) a wealthy Chinese businessman who built his house and estate on the site.

Situated on a hill, both Ann Siang Road and Ann Siang Hill are lined with elegantly restored shophouses, a prevalent building type in Singapore’s architectural heritage, and richly decorated terraces. Most of these buildings were constructed between 1903 and 1941. The typical shophouse is a two or three storey building with a shop on the ground floor and living quarters above.

Another heritage landmark next to Ann Siang Road is Sri Mariamman Temple on South Bridge Road. Established in 1827, it is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore and was constructed by immigrants from the Nagapatnam and Cuddalore districts of South India. The temple, managed by the Hindu Endowments Board, was gazetted as a national monument on 6 July 1973.

Chua trained under Singaporean master brush painter, Fang Chang Tien of the Shanghai School, but later developed a keen interest in Western art. The blend of traditional Chinese art forms and Western art techniques feature prominently in Chua`s paintings. He was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1999.

<a name="shoppast"></a>


 ![shoppast](/images/arts/visualarts/V2-SHOP.png)


Singapore’s colourful shopping history is captured in these paintings of days gone by, where one could buy produce or furniture and homewares from shophouses, queue up for street peddlers who lined the streets, and soak in the mood and late-night treats offered by various hawkers in markets.

The shophouse is a recognisable architectural icon in Singapore’s building heritage. Used either as a residence, a commercial space or both, the shophouse has a unique five-foot way along its street front. This also gave rise to the term “five-foot-way traders”, craftsmen who plied their trade along the narrow walkway. These traders included fortune-tellers, letter writers, barbers and others. Bustling businesses in the shophouses spanned from selling homewares made of rattan and copra to Chinese medicinal halls.

The different shades of watercolour and ink in these paintings and excerpts of old Singapore street scenes record the old and vanishing scenes of Singapore as she underwent rapid urbanisation and modernisation.
