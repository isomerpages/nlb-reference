# Art Movements

The study of the development of art styles is an important component of art history.[^1] An art movement can be said to have emerged when “a style or prevailing inclination in art or design that upholds a specific philosophy or ideal and is followed and promoted by a group of artists for a defined period of time.”[^2]  

With changing social and economic environment, in around mid-19th century, artists who self-consciously challenged traditional art practices in a radical way emerged. At around the turn of the 20th century, the numbers of such aesthetically radical artists grew large enough to form a community.[^3] The 20th century thus became a period of interest as it saw many different types of art movements, such as Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism and Pop Art, advocating for different artistic ideals appeared. During the same period in Singapore, while the development of art was influenced by international art movements, other historical circumstances also played an integral role in the emergence of art movements, like the Nanyang art movement in Singapore.
