### <u>Introduction</u>

Paul Krugman in The Age of Diminished Expectations, famously wrote, “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything”. This holds true, as increasing living standards depend on increasing productivity. Simply put, productivity is the efficiency with which resources or “input factors” such as labour and capital, are converted into output such as goods and services. Governments the world over are attempting to drive productivity by removing barriers and fixing policy failures.

According to Robert Atkinson, in [“Think like an enterprise: Why nations need comprehensive productivity strategies”](http://www2.itif.org/2016-think-like-an-enterprise.pdf), effective productivity policies need to embrace four key components:

* Incentives, including tax policies, to encourage organisations to adopt new tools to drive productivity.
* Policies to spur the advancement and take-up of systemic, platform technologies that accelerate productivity across industries.
* A research and development (R&D) strategy focused on spurring the development of productivity-enabling technologies such as robotics.
* Sectorial productivity policies that reflect the unique differences between industries.

This resource guide presents relevant reports and studies that look at: the steps Japan can take to reignite its productivity and growth; United Kingdom’s productivity plan and an evaluation of its Futures Programme that aims to tackle the causes of low productivity; the feasibility of adopting Germany’s Industry 4.0 concept to other European Union member countries; a historical case study on Singapore’s productivity journey; Germany’s high-tech innovation strategy and its policy efforts to enlarge innovative SMEs in the country; the “factory of the future” and how manufacturers can enhance production; and the potential of automation and which sectors have a higher chance of being automated in the future.
 

### <u>The future of Japan: Reigniting productivity and growth</u>

Japan is formulating many policies such as Abenomics to address the long-standing structural barriers that have hampered productivity. This report opines that policy alone cannot solve the challenges, but a broader agenda for change is needed with private sector taking the lead. Companies can grow revenues and be operationally efficient by adopting global best practices, deploying next-generation technologies, and organising for discipline and performance. The report estimates that one-third of the productivity potential can be captured by the advanced manufacturing, retail, financial services and health care sectors.

### <u>Evaluation of the UK Futures Programme: Conclusion and guidance</u>

The UK Futures Programme offers public co-investment to employers and industry to tackle the causes of low productivity. This evaluation report analyses how five productivity challenges are addressed by the programme. The key learnings highlight the importance of: highly specified and targeted productivity challenges; strong employer leadership and engagement; collaborative solutions; a strong emphasis on developing new and innovative approaches; and a strong learning component; among others. UK’s productivity plan, “Fixing the foundations: Creating a more prosperous nation” can be accessed here.

### <u>Industry 4.0</u>

This study was commissioned to inform the European Parliament debate on the role of connecting digital technologies with industrial products and services. It describes Industry 4.0, “the organisation of production processes based on technology and devices autonomously communicating with each other along the value chain”, a concept developed by the German government. It explores three dimensions of change – technological change, social change and change in the business paradigm – and the policy approaches needed to support Industry 4.0.

### <u>Singapore’s productivity challenge: A historical perspective</u>

This case study provides a historical background on Singapore’s policy decisions in economic development and their impact on labour productivity.

**1960s – Singapore’s first industralisation drive**. The Singapore government invited the United Nations survey team to help shape the nation’s economic development for the subsequent decades. Two important recommendations adopted were: a very high level of openness to foreign investments and relatively liberal immigration policies. The Economic Development Board (EDB) was set up to attract foreign investments into Singapore.

**1970s – The start of Singapore’s dependence on foreign labour**. Attracting investments had created jobs and full employment. Singapore had to resort to importing large number of immigrant workers from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand, to meet growing demand for labour. In 1972, the National Productivity Centre was made a full statutory board and adopted a “total productivity approach” to promote productivity consciousness among employers and workers as well as provide managerial and technical training to companies in Singapore.

**1980s – The ‘Second Industrial Revolution’**. In 1978, the dangers of depending on labour-intensive industries made the government shift the economy towards capital-intensive industries.

**1985 – Singapore’s first recession**. Despite credible performance of the economy in the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy contracted in 1985 and several domestic and policy-induced causes were identified for the recession. The focus shifted from improving productivity to keeping unemployment low and the economy growing.

**1990s – Emerging criticism of Singapore’s growth model**. With its reliance on labour force growth rather than increases in economic efficiency.

**1997 – The Asian Financial Crisis**. The Singapore economy was in recession in 1998 but escaped relatively unscathed because of its strong macroeconomic fundamentals and timely government interventions.

**2000s – A decade of economic volatility**. With the 2001 global electronics crash, the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2007/2008 global financial crisis, and despite the continued reliance of the economy on foreign labour, the government made a concerted effort to shift industries towards products and services with higher innovation and technology content, and encourage an innovation-driven economy.

**2010s – A renewed zeal for productivity.** The 2010 budget introduced a slew of measures to achieve the Economic Strategies Committee’s (ESC) labour productivity target and manage the dependence on foreign workers.

**2015 – Structural obstacles to growing labour productivity**. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance labour productivity, some impediments encountered include: dependence on foreign labour and labour force growth; the two-tire economy; and entrenched business interests.

**The current outlook** – With the halfway mark of the 10-year economic restructuring plan fast approaching, the growth in labour productivity has so far lagged the two to three percent per annum target set by the ESC, averaging just 0.2 percent per year from 2010 to 2013.

### <u>The new high-tech strategy innovations for Germany</u>

Germany’s High-Tech Strategy, a comprehensive, interdepartmental innovation strategy looks at new instruments for funding technological as well as social innovation. To enlarge the group of innovative SMEs, Germany supports the use of key technologies for new products and services; has a coordinated and effective system of innovation funding; has programmes to increase the numbers of start-ups especially for those in the early phases of new technological developments; and enhances innovation resources.

### <u>The factory of the future</u>

This global survey report of leading companies in the automotive, engineered products and process industries, provides insights on what the factory of the future will be like with respect to its structure, technologies and processes. The factory of the future is a vision for how manufacturers should enhance production by making improvements in three dimensions: plant structure, plant digitisation and plant processes; and should have a fully integrated value chain. The three enablers that need to be addressed to achieve this include: strategy and leadership; employee skills; and IT infrastructure.

### <u>Where machines could replace humans – and where they can’t (yet)</u>

In the next decade, automation will affect almost all jobs to greater or lesser degrees and has the potential to transform the healthcare and finance sectors. This article discusses the potential of automation; the most “automatable activities”; activities and sectors in the middle range for automation and those with low technical potential for it; as well as the future ahead; and foresees people leading more automated enterprises.
