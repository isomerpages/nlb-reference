### <u>Introduction</u>

In your schooling years, you will be exposed to a multitude of experiences and start to develop preferences and dislikes, and may also wonder what kind of work you would like to do upon leaving school.

The types of jobs and specialisations available today are more varied than before. It is important to start thinking about long-terms goals and aspirations and start gearing your life towards achieving them.

Being aware of your passions, interests and values is a key step in your career exploration at any stage. With guidance from your parents, teachers and counsellors and some management of expectations, you can be better informed and equipped with a detailed roadmap to help you get started on your dream vocation.

Besides deepening your technical knowledge, it would be good to also sharpen your soft skills in areas such as communication, emotional intelligence and resource management. A skillful application of both hard and soft skills will benefit you greatly in your studies as well as at work and enable you to reach greater heights in both your personal and professional spheres of life.

This guide provides recommended resources on education and career guidance for students (secondary to tertiary levels) that are available from NLB as well as on the Internet. As the guide is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources
