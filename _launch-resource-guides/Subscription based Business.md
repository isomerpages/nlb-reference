# Subscription-based Business 

The concept of a subscription-based business is not new, as we have seen with magazines, newspapers and membership programmes. For a business, a subscription ensures a stable customer base and longer\-term revenue. 

The rise of digital and online services has afforded enterprising individuals the ability to provide subscriptions to several new types of products. Subscribed products can now include curated physical goods (e.g. meal kits, men’s razors, beauty products, car rentals), digital products (e.g. digital games, videos, art, meditation guides) or other services, i.e. the X-as-a-Service (XaaS) concept. This gives creative entrepreneurs the potential to sell a broad range of new products and services to a new base of customers. 

The challenge for new subscription-based businesses is to figure out how to continually engage subscribed customers with interesting and relevant content, to reduce the likelihood of them terminating the subscription. Being able to innovate, while maintaining production costs and avoiding creative or administrative burnout, requires good planning and management. Ultimately, an entrepreneur who is able to maintain a subscription-based business with a sustainable long-term plan is in a comparatively better position for lasting success.
