# Negotiation

Negotiation is a discussion between two or more parties over an issue, where all parties want to reach a beneficial outcome or agreeable end goal. Negotiation may seem like a difficult business process, but it is an interaction that is very present in our everyday lives. You might be trying to get a better price on a car, or you might be trying to get someone else to take out the trash. Either way, negotiation is an important skill to learn for building relationships and getting what you want. To become a successful negotiator, it is crucial to find out what strategies and negotiation styles work best for you. It is also essential to enter a discussion prepared, knowing what your position and and what the other party wants including the strengths and weaknesses of their position.  

The objective behind a successful negotiation is for both parties to believe that they have attained a win-win situation.

### Journal articles 

(*MyLibraryID* is required to access the journal articles from NLB’s [eResources website](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/)) 


- **Bounded ethicality and ethical fading in negotiations: Understanding unintended unethical behavior**

	Rees, McKenzie R., Ann E. Tenbrunsel, and Max H. Bazerman, “Bounded ethicality and ethical fading in negotiations: Understanding unintended unethical behavior,” Academy of Management Perspectives 33, no. 1 (February 2019): 26-42. Retrieved 2021, August 19, from [EBSCOHost Business Source Complete](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1049) via NLB’s eResources website.
	
	This article explores ethical decision making in the context of negotiation, arguing that not all unethical behaviour in negotiating is intentional. The authors use research to identify negotiation cues that are linked to unethical behaviour and explain why individuals sometimes do not see the ethical implications of their actions.  


- **Compromise in negotiation** 

	May, Simon Cabulea, “Compromise in negotiation,” Nomos 59, (2018): 150-166. Retrieved 2021, August 31, from [JSTOR Journals](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1322/) via NLB’s eResources website.
	
	Compromise is bound to come up during any kind of negotiation. May explores the role of compromise in dispute resolution and challenges its inherent meaning and the biases that surround it. 


- **In search of master negotiators: A negotiation competency model** 

	Smolinski, Remigiusz, and Yun Xiong, “In search of master negotiators: A negotiation competency model,” Negotiation Journal 36, no. 3 (July 2020): 365-388. Retrieved 2021, September 2, from [ProQuest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/) via NLB’s eResources website. 

	As the field of negotiation becomes more fully recognised as an academic discipline, many believe that negotiation is a skill that can be taught and evaluated. In this article, the authors propose a negotiation competency model for evaluating negotiation performance, specifically looking at proficiency levels and behavioural influences. Having this model in mind can help negotiators become more effective and well-prepared in their negotiations. 


- **The power of lost alternatives in negotiations**

	Brady, Garrett L., M. Ena Inesi, and Thomas Mussweller, “The power of lost alternatives in negotiations,” Organizational Behavior & Human Decision Processes 162, (January 2021): 59-80. Retrieved 2021, August 31, from [EBSCOHost Business Source Complete](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1049/) via NLB’s eResources website.
	
	Having attractive alternatives is often viewed as essential for negotiation success. However, such alternatives are never guaranteed and are sometimes lost. This study demonstrates that losing an attractive alternative is still advantageous, compared to not having an alternative at all, and shows how negotiators can use that to their benefit.  


- **The role of regulatory focus and emotion recognition bias in cross-cultural negotiation** 

	Han, Donghee, Hyewon Park, and Seung-Yoon Rhee, “The role of regulatory focus and emotion recognition bias in cross-cultural negotiation,” Sustainability 13, no. 5 (March 2021): 2659. Retrieved 2021, September 2, from [ProQuest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/) via NLB’s eResources website.
	
	This article explores the role of emotion and motivation in cross-cultural negotiations, proposing that cultural differences will lead to cultural biases in emotion recognition, which in turn will affect negotiation behaviours. Through a study on negotiation processes via various cross-cultural contexts, the authors highlight different inclinations and assumptions that could arise during international negotiations.
