# **Mental Health in the Workplace**


Mental health is multi-faceted, affecting individuals in a variety of ways ranging from anxiety and depression to panic attacks and hyperventilation. Its causes are also diverse. 

Mental health in the workplace has recently begun to be taken seriously by organisations. Research has shown that employees with poor mental health can affect businesses negatively, harming job performance, work engagement, co-worker communication and teamwork. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this topic even more prominent, as many employees transitioned to work-from-home, resulting in increased social segregation and isolation. Technology-facilitated communication such as online conferencing is not sufficient to fully replace the social interactions which humans, as social animals, require. 

Organisations have hence started to give mental health the same level of consideration as physical health, with some companies allowing their employees to take time off for mental health reasons. Some have also extended psychological counselling sessions and mental well-being programmes to their employees as workplace benefits. Likewise, employees (current and potential) have also started to pay attention to the support and resources which employers make available with regards to their mental health in the workplace. Work-life balance is now a serious consideration which job-seekers look out for, and companies are likewise introducing policies such as flexible working arrangements to cater to these needs.

This guide provides supplementary resources for those who are keen to further explore this topic. You can also visit NLB's [online catalogue](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg) to search for more resources.
