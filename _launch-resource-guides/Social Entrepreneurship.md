# **Introduction**

Social entrepreneurship looks beyond simply making money in a business and is driven by the passion to change a current situation for the better. It could be to right a social injustice, empower the marginalised, or support conservation efforts, amongst many other causes. While there are many social enterprises out there, you do not have to be running your own business to be a social entrepreneur. Social entrepreneurs can be employed in other businesses, government bodies or non-profit organisations. As a result, social entrepreneurship often comes as an additional responsibility, rather than a personal desire.  

Whether you have a burning passion to address a certain social or public issue, or the task of improving the problem has been thrust into your hands, this resource guide lists some resources on social entrepreneurship which are available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and on the Internet. Interested readers are recommended to search the [NLB catalogue](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/) for more resources. Academic journal and research articles can be found from NLB’s [subscribed databases](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/).
