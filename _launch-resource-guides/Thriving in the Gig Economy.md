## Introduction 

In a gig economy, digital platforms are used to match independent contractors with clients for short contract work stints and payment-by-task basis. Examples of such work include delivery services, freelance design/ writing/ coding/ administrative work, and providing household cleaning and baby-sitting services. Employment on the gig-economy platform currently comprises less than three percent of the global employment market share but it is a fast-developing sector. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the global gig-economy is projected to grow by 17 percent yearly to reach US$455 billion by 2023. Flexibility, independence and the opportunity to earn a supplemental income are the common reasons which attract people to the gig economy, although some take on such jobs as they are unable to find full\-time employment.

#### Gig economy platforms: Boon or bane? 

Schwellnus, Cyrille, Geva, Assaf, Pak, Mathilde and Veiel, Rafael. (2019, May 15). "Gig economy platforms: Boon or bane?". [https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/gig-economy-platforms-boon-or-bane_fdb0570b-en#page1](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/gig-economy-platforms-boon-or-bane_fdb0570b-en#page1)

Gig economy platform employment comprises less than three percent of overall employment, with the growth primarily fueled by the service industries. To protect consumers and workers, the paper recommends that product market regulation, competition, tax and labour market policies which traditional employment is subjected to, also be applied to the gig economy platforms.

The rise of the gig economy has been plainly visible in recent years, particularly with the creation of digital platforms and apps. Gig work offers an alternative job opportunity for workers during economic downturns and it is seen as a precursor for retirement. While gig workers enjoy the flexibility of their work stints, they face fluctuations in income, worry over when the next gig might be and are also not entitled to worker protection policies which are accorded traditional work.

A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in August 2021 found that 16 percent of Americans have earned a salary from online gig platforms. The work performed comprised of making deliveries, running errands, shopping or delivering groceries and working as a private hire driver. Among current or recent gig workers, around 30 percent reveal that this type of work has been their main source of income over the past year.
