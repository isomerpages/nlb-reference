## <u>Introduction</u>

“Fast fashion,” a term used to describe inexpensive and widely-available “in the moment” garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing. By making available large quantities of clothing at throwaway prices, fast fashion has emerged as a dominant business model, causing garment consumption to soar. While this trend may be considered as the “democratisation” of fashion in which the latest styles are available to all classes of consumers, the human and environmental health risks associated with fast fashion are said to be hidden throughout the life-cycle of each piece of clothing. 

Fast fashion’s speedy supply chains rely on outsourced and often underpaid labour from factory workers overseas, and the process is environmentally damaging and resource-intensive. Critics claim that the “blindingly fast pace at which fast fashion clothes are manufactured, worn and discarded means that they have become more disposable, more commodities than keepsakes, and shoppers are essentially conditioned to expect a constant stream of new items.” 

This resource guide shines the spotlight on the phenomenon of fast fashion, why it is so popular, its environmental impacts, and alternative fashion trends that counter it. 

The guide provides supplementary resources for those who are keen to further explore this topic. You can also visit <https://search.nlb.gov.sg/> to search for more resources.

##### **Ultra fast-fashion is eating the world**

Even during the COVID-19 pandemic with the world economy taking a massive hit, demand for “cheap, cute clothes” is said to have persisted. While the rest of the retail sector struggled, a new cohort of companies such as Boohoo and Asos, known as ultra-fast fashion, thrived. Asos’ sales rose rapidly from March to June 2020 and Boohoo was reported to have had its “best quarter ever.” These companies leveraged digital platforms to fulfill their customers’ demand for fast fashion.

##### **Why professional women are breaking up with fast fashion**

With the killing of over 1,000 factory workers in the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh in 2013, professional women have started wondering about the true cost of making fast fashion clothes. Many fast fashion brands outsource their production overseas where garments are produced with unfair pay and poor work conditions. Professional women who support sustainability are reported to have now turned to circular fashion, a system in which articles are circulated and reused for as long as they can be, before being decomposed safely.

##### **Fast fashion is on the rampage, with the UK at the head of the charge**

Fashion consumers in the United Kingdom are reported to be among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the largest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfills in 2018.

##### **The true cost of fast fashion**

Fast fashion allows consumers to buy more clothes, but they are wearing them less often and disposing of them at an unprecedented rate. Millions of tonnes of clothes are reported to be ending up in landfills every year. This video takes a look at how the fashion industry can continue to grow while addressing the environmental need for people to buy fewer clothes.

The speaker in this video laments that “fast fashion is fooling us to believe we are saving money when in reality all we are doing is buying more of a lower quality product.” More importantly, “fast fashion is destroying people in the planet depending on where the products are made, how they are made, and where they ultimately end up.”

##### Are low- and middle-income countries profiting from fast fashion?

Low- and middle-income countries have made substantial economic progress in the past two decades due to the fast fashion industry. This, however, has come at a high social and environmental cost. This article suggests that now is the right time to find a balance between economic development and harm caused to the citizens of these nations.
