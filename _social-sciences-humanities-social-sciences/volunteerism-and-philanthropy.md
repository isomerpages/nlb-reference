### <u>Introduction</u>

Volunteerism and philanthropy are not only about giving time and money to causes deemed to be worthwhile. Both benefit the causes that charities serve as well as individuals and organisations. Individuals benefit by gaining new experiences and insights and connecting with people and it provides them with a sense of accomplishment. Organisations benefit when their involvement result in the strengthening of bonds between colleagues and neighbours and in helping to attract and retain younger workers who are keen to work for organisations that are active in philanthropy and offering voluntary services to the community.

Many organisations have warmed up to the benefits of involving themselves in volunteerism and philanthropy activities. In this regard, these organisations encourage staff involvement by giving employees paid time-off, organising events and matching employees’ donations, amongst others. They also facilitate employee giving through payroll deductions to charities, something which the Singapore Government is already doing.

Some governments are also showing an interest in growing volunteerism and philanthropy in their respective countries. For instance, both the United Kingdom and Singapore allow donors to claim tax relief. In particular, Singapore’s National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) heads efforts to influence people to give through connecting and convening “to create networks and build communities to impact the giving space on the national level.”

This resource guide presents relevant reports and studies that looks not only at the global volunteerism and philanthropy landscape, but also at the European and local ones. It also looks at how people in the United Kingdom give and how some companies in Singapore are involved in this endeavour.

 

### <u>A flourishing European philanthropy sector</u>

Philanthropic culture is making progress in Europe. German foundations spent €17 billion in 2014, more than any other European country, while the average spending per foundation in France was €2 million per year. French donors prefer giving to their less fortunate compatriots while Germans, Belgians and Swiss prefer giving to international and humanitarian aid. As for the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, individual philanthropists prefer giving to religious causes.

### <u>CAF world giving index 2015: A global view of giving trends</u>

This index gives “an insight into the nature and scope of giving around the world.” It looks at giving in terms of helping a stranger, donating money to a charity, and volunteering time to an organisation. It also looks at the impact of religion, cultural heritage and disruptive events such as wars, on giving. Worldwide, monetary donations have gone up; but people in big countries such as China and India are giving less. More men are likely to give then women. The report also provides recommendations for governments to encourage giving and strengthen the processes involved.

### <u>Spotlight series: Employee engagement</u>

Engaging employees in corporate giving is effective in inculcating a spirit of giving throughout an organisation. It helps them feel that they are “personally contributing and giving back to the community”; improves company loyalty; and employees are more likely to recommend friends to the company, and employees are more likely to be satisfied with their employees. This document also suggests ways to increase employee engagement and motivation and provides examples of two companies in Singapore that are successful in this endeavour.

### <u>Case Study</u>

**UK giving 2015: An overview of charitable giving in the UK during 2015**

A survey of 12,000 people in 2015 found that monetary donations is the favoured form of charitable giving. Older people and women were more likely to donate to charity. The median monthly amount given by a donor was £14 and the mean donation was £37.


**Donating money**

Donating money to charity was the most common form of charitable giving, with 67 percent of people giving money or sponsoring someone. This is followed by giving goods to charity (46 percent), sponsoring someone for a charity (32 percent) and volunteering for charity (13 percent).

The findings further suggest that donating money in the United Kingdom was largely driven by events such as the Nepal Earthquake Appeal, Comic Relief, the Poppy Appeal, Movember, and the Syria Crisis Appeal. Forty-seven percent who donate do so through Gift Aid, which allows beneficiaries to claim an extra 25p for every £1 given.


**Volunteering for a charity**

In 2015, 13 percent claimed to have volunteered for a charity in the 12 months prior to the interview. Those in full-time education were more than twice as likely to volunteer their time, as compared to those who were employed, unemployed or retired (14 percent versus six percent overall).


**Giving goods**

Giving goods is the second-most popular form of giving to charity, with 46 percent having done so in 2015. People between the ages of 45 and 64 were more likely to give in this manner.


**Frequency of giving**

Forty-one percent gave occasionally; 31 percent gave monthly, especially those between 45 and 64 years of age; and five percent gave weekly.


**Beneficiaries**

The most popular causes in 2015 were children and older people (30 percent); medical research (29 percent); animals (22 percent); and hospitals/hospices (20 percent). The arts were the least supported cause (one percent)


**Who were the givers?**

More women than men gave to animal and children’s charities; young people were most likely to give to educational institutions; older people preferred giving to religious charities and hospitals/hospices; and those aged 45 to 64 were most likely to give to animal, conservation, environment, heritage and overseas causes.


**Mode of giving**

Cheque and direct debits were most popular modes of giving among older givers while younger givers preferred making cash donations. Women were more likely to buy goods, a raffle or lottery tickets.

### <u>Enhanced tax deduction to promote philanthropy and volunteerism</u>

Business and Institution of a Public Character (IPC) Partnership Scheme (BIPS) was first introduced in the 2016 Budget “to encourage businesses to support philanthropic activities through employee volunteerism or secondments.” This document discusses how this scheme works, as well as the tax breaks qualifying businesses enjoy when their employees volunteer and provide services to IPCs between 1 July 2016 and 31 December 2018.
