The nonprofits sector is the sum of private, voluntary, nonprofit organisations and associations.

This is a resource guide to some of the resources available within the National Library Board of Singapore which are relevant to nonprofit organisations, boards of directors, social service associations and others.

Inside you will find sources of information from books, journal articles, case studies and Internet sources pertaining to the effectiveness of nonprofit boards, organisations and associations.
