Artificial intelligence and machine learning are undisputed game-changers in the entertainment and media industry, revolutionising how audiences will watch movies, play games, engage in sports and indulge in other recreational pursuits. The AI market in the media and entertainment industry is projected to more than quadruple from US$1.8 billion in 2018 to US$8.4 billion in 2023.[^1]

The evolution of technological software and inventions of increasingly sophisticated content creation tools have changed how content is created and distributed. There are numerous examples today in the entertainment business where AI is used to improve productivity, to propel the human imagination to stratospheric heights and to enhance the consumer experience. AI automation has helped entertainers and content creators better hone their craft to deliver higher quality content and AI-powered data analytics have enabled production houses to make strategic and lucrative marketing and advertising decisions.[^2]

Other examples of AI applications in the entertainment industry include[^3]:

* Personalisation of content, using AI algorithms to push out content which match the viewers' interests
* Automation of certain stages in movie production, such as storyboarding, sound production, scheduling and even managing of movie budgets, shortening the time for movies to hit the screens
* Automation of transcription and subtitles using natural language processing, speeding up the post-production process 
* Prediction of gamers' behavior in computer and video games, resulting in a more immersive and challenging experience for consumers
* Contents categorisation and classification, leading to improved customer engagement and higher sales
* AI-powered search optimisation which renders more accurate search results, thereby improving customer satisfaction

With technology advancing at warp-speed, there are limitless possibilities where AI can be deployed to thrill, delight and entertain the masses.
