Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are an enormous boost for the tourism sector particularly in the post-COVID normal when many countries have re-opened borders and are re-invigorating their travel industry. 

AI is revolutionising the travel business through digitalisation with the aim to elevate the entire travel experience and increase customer satisfaction.

The advantages for the travel industry to invest in AI-powered software are plentiful[^1]: 

* Smart travel apps can help customers to discover new places to visit and activities to experience and provide personalised travel packages
* AI digital assistants and chatbots can attend to queries and provide online assistance 24/7
* AI systems can acquire and analyse data to provide insights on streamlining business operations, designing effective branding, pricing and marketing strategies 
* Facial recognition technology provides travellers with a secured, smooth and seamless travel across international borders
* Automated baggage systems at airports can improve the efficiency and reliability for luggage check-ins and collections 
* AI can also be used to alleviate the perennial manpower shortage in the hospitality industry and improve overall efficiency with less manpower

There are countless possibilities for how intelligent automation can be employed to benefit both players in the travel industry and travellers. A dazzling future lies ahead where the ideal travel experience can be created at the touch of one's fingertip.
