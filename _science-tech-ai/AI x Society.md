In a Pew Research survey in 2018, 979 technology-field experts were asked this question: By 2030, as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread and become adopted, will people be better off than they are today? 63% were hopeful that individuals would be better off.[^1] This may be a majority, but some disagreement implies hesitation.

Some believe that AI will bring about technological developments thereby saving time, money, resources amongst others factors, leading to societal advancements and major improvements in everyone’s lives. AI is already being used to discover and develop new drugs in medicine, report crimes such as sexual harassment, exploitation and human trafficking, and optimising the flow and generation of green energy.[^2]

[^2]: Sukhadeve, Ashish. “Artificial Intelligence for Good: How AI Is Helping Humanity.” Forbes, April 14, 2022. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/09/artificial-intelligence-for-good-how-ai-is-helping-humanity/>

Others however fear that these advanced AIs could be misused or even harm people, intentionally or otherwise. Some fear the job losses which AI and automation may lead to, and others fear that AI could be used as a tool by bad actors, the military, or governments to control the masses. A major fear is also the potential for a super-intelligent AI that takes over humanity as it becomes too powerful to control.[^3]

[^3]: Schmelzer, Ron. “Should We Be Afraid of Ai?” Forbes, October 31, 2019. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/31/should-we-be-afraid-of-ai/>

Some of these fears may seem far-fetched, but they mainly result from the lack of clarity on where AI development is heading towards, and how soon these changes will happen. The sooner we grapple with the potential impact of AI on human society, the better we can picture the future of AI research (and what we should avoid). AI may still have some way to go, but these crucial questions will serve as moral and ethical signposts to guide AI development.
