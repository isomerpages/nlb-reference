# COVID-19 Resilience and Restrictions

This resource guide is curated to complement the Read to be Sure Learning Package on COVID-19 restrictions.

## COVID-19 Resilience and Restrictions 

COVID-19 has had an increasingly devastating impact since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a [pandemic](https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020) in March 2020  COVID-19 has challenged national and global capacities to prepare and respond. Many countries have implemented [restrictions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92766-z) to curb the spread of the virus and prevent [health systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01381-y) from becoming overwhelmed. The relative success of the various national strategies taken to control viral transmission depends largely on the resilience of health systems in managing the pandemic.

We now have the knowledge and tools needed to control the pandemic. [Vaccine mandates](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/countries-making-covid-19-vaccines-mandatory-2021-08-16/) have been deployed broadly, and new [treatments](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/treatments-for-covid-19) show promise in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19. The WHO has called for countries to use masks, social distancing, proper ventilation and hand hygiene to [prevent contagion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/who-says-omicron-is-spreading-at-a-rate-not-seen-with-any-other-covid-variant.html). Countries that have strong healthcare safety nets and societal cohesion are more [resilient](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/a-year-of-ranking-covid-19-resilience-reveals-virus-volatility) to COVID-19. [Trust](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8144822/) in government and people’s willingness to comply with rules help with containing the virus. 

“Parts of the [world](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02790-2/fulltext#coronavirus-linkback-header) are approaching a transition or a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Moving into a post-pandemic world will be more complicated than scenarios such as “Zero COVID.” The challenge is for individual nations to determine the acceptable level of COVID-19 in an interconnected world.

This resource guide shines the spotlight on various COVID-19 restrictions and measures, how to live with COVID-19 as well as the future of the pandemic.

**To get through the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to learn how to live in an ongoing disaster**

COVID-19 does not respond to established practices of how we deal with disaster. We need to learn how to live in an ongoing disaster for the foreseeable future. Emergency management planning often entails a four-phase disaster cycle: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. We are still in the emergency part of the pandemic. Recovery is not yet discernible. People are too fatigued to be in a constant state of preparedness. Mitigation is a distant goal at this juncture. “We just have to cope as best we can by hunkering down.”

**Vaccine mandates**

Several countries have introduced vaccine mandates, which are “a way to compel people to get vaccinations.” This could mean that a person must be vaccinated or be excluded from certain activities and locations like food and beverage establishments or workplaces. Vaccine mandates in relation to childhood vaccinations have been around for a long time. Vaccine mandates aim to increase vaccination rates by incentivising people to get vaccinated. Vaccine mandates also raise ethical questions. Some people consider them an infringement of individual liberty. Vaccine mandates might exacerbate inequity for the most vulnerable or marginalised.

**New variants show why the world urgently needs vaccine equity**

Low-income countries have much lower Covid-19 vaccination rates compared to high-income countries. The persistent presence of large unvaccinated populations globally increases the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants, as in the case of Omicron. Omicron reminds us of the need to expedite efforts to protect populations everywhere. If we cannot address vaccine inequity, we will continue to face the risk of a prolonged pandemic, with the emergence of new variants and constant changes between the opening and closing of schools, offices, restaurants, borders and economies.

**Omicronomics: China’s economy looks especially vulnerable to the spread of Omicron** 

The Omicron variant may further establish China’s strict restrictions on business travel. Omicron may cause more disruption to China’s economy than to other countries with high GDP. China’s zero-COVID policy requires at least 14 days of quarantine in a hotel for international visitors. Travel is essential to innovation. The restrictions on cross-border travel will have a negative impact on innovation. If Omicron is more contagious than other strains, it will increase the likelihood of COVID-19 outbreaks and more frequent lockdowns in China.

**Finance industry group ups pressure on Hong Kong to abandon COVID-zero policy, ease restrictions **

A financial industry group said that Hong Kong’s zero-COVID policy and strict quarantine requirements for international travellers threaten to undermine the city’s status as a financial hub. The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said a survey of its members indicated that 48 percent of companies were considering moving staff or functions away from Hong Kong due to operational challenges. Hong Kong has some of the world’s tightest travel restrictions; and has no public plan for opening up to international travellers.
