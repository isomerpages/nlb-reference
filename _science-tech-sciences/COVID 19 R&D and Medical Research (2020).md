The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has galvanized the scientific community to combat this disease. Over 120 institutes and publishers have become signatories of the Wellcome Trust’s statement[^1] on sharing research data and findings relevant to the outbreak. They have committed to providing all their latest research and publications pertaining to the outbreak free-of-charge or through open access, as well as to share updated information and recent developments. Besides the scientific community, it is also important for such research to be made available to the public to avoid misinformation and rumours about COVID-19.

As research progresses, advances are being made in combating the virus, mitigating its impact on health, and avoiding potential outbreaks. Scientists are searching for the exact source and origin of the coronavirus, which will provide clues about its possible zoonotic history. They are developing multiple and quicker ways to test for the virus to enable early diagnosis and treatment. They are examining data to inform public health interventions and implement measures to limit the impact of the disease. Medical research is ongoing to find a safe and effective way to treat the disease as well as develop a vaccine. All these take time, but a consolidated global effort will reduce the time needed to develop solutions in a safe,
scientific and medically sound manner.[^2]

Other studies, such as the social and psychological impact of the virus, its effects on scientific research and policy studies surrounding public health, are also ongoing. As a result, published research is growing week by week.[^3]
