In late 2019, Singapore’s medical practitioners took notice when reports of severe pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China emerged. Soon after, temperature screening at Changi Airport was implemented.[^1] In addition, a multi-ministry taskforce co-chaired by Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong and Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong was formed on 23 January 2020 to “deal with the eventuality” of the virus spreading to Singapore.[^2]

That same day, Singapore reported its first imported case of COVID-19.[^3] The first cases of local transmission were reported on 4 February 2020.[^4] By 4 April 2020, there were 1,189 confirmed cases and six deaths.[^5]

Measures to minimise the risk of transmission such as contact tracing were put in place when confirmed cases were reported.[^6] The Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON), which reflects the current disease situation, was raised from Yellow to Orange on 7 February 2020 indicating that the virus, while severe and spreading easily, was being contained. Additional precautionary measures were then introduced such as the suspension of inter-school and external activities such as the national school games, learning journeys and camps, daily workplace health checks and stepping up of business continuity plans.[^7]

Over the weeks, other measures were introduced including Leave of Absence (LOA) or Stay-Home notices (SHN); safe distancing; closure of public entertainment venues and advisories to cancel or defer non-essential events and mass gatherings.[^8] When rates of infection, particularly unlinked cases continued on an upward trend, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 3 April 2020, announced a slew of additional measures to contain the outbreak. These include closing most workplaces, moving to full home-based learning for schools and institutes of higher learning; and restrictions on movement and gatherings of people. These measures would take effect from 7 April to 4 May 2020.[^9]
