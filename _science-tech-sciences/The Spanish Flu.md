“I had a little bird<br> 
its name was Enza<br> 
I opened the window,<br> 
And in-flu-enza.”

(1918 children’s jump rope rhyme)[^1]

The influenza pandemic from 1918 to 1919 is also known as the Spanish Flu, or La Grippe, although the first known case was reported at a military base in Kansas, United States on 11 March 1918.[^2] As a neutral country during World War I, Spain was able to freely report on the outbreak unlike most European media that had either imposed a news blackout or downplayed the virus to maintain high morale. Hence, with most of the news about the flu reported from Spain, the origin of the outbreak was mistakenly attributed to the country.[^3] 

The Spanish Flu circled the globe at a breakneck speed due to massive wartime troop movements during World War I.[^4] It spread swiftly across the world from the U.S. and Europe to Asia, Australia and even the remote Pacific Islands.[^5] Within a year, nearly one third of the world's population (1.8 billion in 1918) were infected and an estimated 50 to 100 million had succumbed to the disease.[^6]

The Spanish Flu was caused by an influenza A virus known as H1N1. As with most strains of influenza, it was contagious, spreading easily through the coughs and/or sneezes of infected persons. In parts of the United States for example, measures such as quarantine, the wearing of masks and closure of public places like schools, were put in place to help slow down transmission.[^7] In Singapore, the colonial government instituted a series of preventive measures.  For example, infected persons were advised to isolate themselves and seek treatment and public premises were disinfected daily.[^8]

An unusual feature of the Spanish Flu was the high mortality in healthy adults. The elderly were less susceptible as they had survived a similar but less virulent strain of the flu in the 1830s.[^9]

844 deaths were officially attributed to the Spanish flu in Singapore. However, the 1918 Annual Report estimated that the actual number of deaths was 3,500 while the 1921 Annual Report added that many deaths reported as pneumonia were due primarily to influenza. These reflected the challenges faced in providing accurate data as tropical countries do not have well-defined influenza seasons.[^10]
