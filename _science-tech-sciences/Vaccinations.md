The world is now racing to find a vaccine for COVID-19. However, what are vaccines and how do they help in preventing disease? This guide provides a range of interesting resources about vaccinations.

In 1796, English physician Edward Jenner inoculated a young boy, James Phipps, with cowpox (a mild and recoverable disease). He later found that young James had become completely immune to smallpox, an infectious and often deadly disease. Jenner termed this new procedure “vaccination”[^1],  derived from the Latin word vaccinia, meaning cowpox. Thus began the path towards the global eradication of smallpox, and a whole new branch of medicine.

As a field, vaccination has been well studied and the process of conception to testing and production is rigorously evaluated to ensure minimal risk to any patient being inoculated. Vaccines are constantly monitored for their safety. For many vaccines, the risk of an adverse allergic reaction is about one per million doses.[^2]  These odds are much less than getting struck by lightning or being involved in a plane crash.
There are many benefits to vaccinations. Vaccines eliminate suffering from preventable diseases. Enough vaccinated individuals results in herd immunity, which prevents the spread of such illnesses by halting possible transmission routes, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as the elderly or immuno-compromised.

While there are many vaccines available in Singapore, certain vaccinations, such as ones against diphtheria and measles, are mandated by law. Immunisation for children, against diseases such as tuberculosis, began as early as the mid-1950s. The National Childhood Immunisation Schedule advises parents on the timeline for vaccinations for children from birth up to 11 years old.[^3]  Several vaccines are also recommended for adults during different stages of their lives.[^4]
