The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first detected in China in late 2019. This highly contagious disease, which causes symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulties, cough, lesions on the lungs and in severe cases, dyspnea and respiratory distress syndrome, began to spread rapidly to other parts of the globe prompting an urgent race to develop a vaccine.[^1] 

Less than a year after the outbreak, several successful trials on potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates have already taken place. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trials.[^2] This is a remarkable achievement, considering that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the fastest time for a vaccine to be developed was four years – the mumps vaccine in the 1960s. Several factors facilitated the development of the COVID-19 vaccines in a short timeframe. These included advances in technology which had sped up the manufacturing processes, the provision of ample funding to facilitate multiple trials and unprecedented support by approving authorities.[^3] 

Below is a diagrammatic overview of how the various COVID-19 vaccines work and how they compare with one another:[^4]

A range of different vaccines are needed to cater to people of varying age groups, health conditions and geographic locations. An estimated two billion vaccine doses are required to vaccinate high-risk groups around the world by end 2021. To ensure equitable access, the <a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility" target="_blank">COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX)</a> was established to support the research, development and manufacturing of a range of COVID-19 vaccines which would be made available to all participating countries irrespective of their economic status.[^5]

On 2 December 2020, the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer and German biotechnology company, BioNTech was granted emergency-use authorisation by the United Kingdom (UK), which was the first country to kick-start its mass vaccination programme in early December 2020. Other countries in Europe (France, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland), Central and South America (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica), North America (Canada, United States, Mexico), the Middle East (Israel, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE), the Balkans (Croatia, Greece, Romania), and Russia followed suit. The Pfizer BioNtech and Moderna vaccines were the most frequently administered, along with the Sputnik V vaccine and the Sinovac vaccine.[^6]

Singapore began its mass vaccination programme on 30 December 2020. According to the vaccination strategy proposed by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 vaccination, vaccinations are offered free of charge to all Singaporeans and long-term residents with the aim to complete the vaccinations by the end of 2021. Currently, only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been given the all-clear from the Health Sciences Authority for use in Singapore for individuals aged 16 and above. Priority for the vaccinations will be given to healthcare and frontline workers, the elderly above 70 years and those with underlying health conditions who are more susceptible to complications upon contracting COVID-19.[^7]

As of 20 January 2021, 54.36 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally. The US tops the chart at 16.53 million doses administered, followed by China (15 million doses) and the UK (5.44 million doses).[^8] For now, the vaccines appear to work even for new variants of the coronavirus that were detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, although there is heightened urgency for early detection of these virus mutations and to accelerate the mass vaccination programmes.[^9]

Medical professionals advise that mask-wearing, social distancing measures and good hygiene habits such as the frequent washing of hands will have to continue in tandem with vaccinations as the best possible strategy for the containment of the virus.[^10]
