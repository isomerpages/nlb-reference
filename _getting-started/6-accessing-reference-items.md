# **Accessing Reference Items**

Collection items in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library are for reference only, and not available for loan. The National Collection also contains many items which are not available on the open shelves. These items may require some additional steps to be retrieved for reference.

All our collection items can be found in our [**NLB Catalogue**](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}. When clicking on **"View Availability"**, a pop-up window will display the respective locations of individual items. Please refer to **"Library"** and **"Section/Shelf Location"** for accessing the materials.

Listed here are the different item locations as you would see under "Section/Shelf Location" for items from the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.
