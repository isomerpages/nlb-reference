# **Accessing Reference Items**

Collection items in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library are for reference only, and not available for loan. The National Collection also contains many items which are not available on the open shelves. These items may require some additional steps to be retrieved for reference.

All our collection items can be found in our [**NLB Catalogue**](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}. When clicking on **"View Availability"**, there will be a pop-up displaying the respective locations of individual items. Please refer to **"Library"** and **"Section/Shelf Location"** to understand where to access the materials.

Listed here are the different item locations as you would see under "Section/Shelf Location" for items from the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

## Items from the **Lee Kong Chian Reference Library** (under Library)

For items from **Lee Kong Chian Reference Library**, please refer to the **Section/Shelf Location** within the catalogue entry:

| Section/Shelf Location                                       | How to access them                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reference, Reference Art, Reference Business, Reference Singapore, Reference Southeast Asia, Reference Chinese Overseas | These items should be available from the open shelves. Please head to the respective level (levels 7-9 or 11) and look for the corresponding shelf number. Items are shelved according to the call numbers. |
| Reference Closed Access, Reference Donor...                  | Upon request at the information counter, these items will be retrieved from our closed stacks by our staff. This might require some time, depending on complexity of the request.<br>- You may plan your visit ahead of time and make a reservation (free of charge) to access these materials to reduce your waiting time. Our staff will email you with instructions on how to retrieve your items for reference during your visit. You may make a booking using [this form](https://go.gov.sg/nlb-reserverclos-refnlbwebsite){:target="_blank"}. |
| Reference Rare                                               | These are rare items with heritage value, and the actual items are not available for reference without written permission. You may request to access these items only if it is necessary to access the physical item for research purposes, and a surrogate copy is not suitable or not available. Please write to [ref@nlb.gov.sg](mailto:ref@nlb.gov.sg) with your detailed request to access the physical items.<br>- Alternatively, surrogate copies of many of these items are available for reference. Please refer to **Shelving Notes** (typically a microfilm with beginning with NL-----), or **Electronic Access** for a digital surrogate copy (mostly accessible from home, or otherwise available at a dedicated terminal at Level 11 of the Library). |

## Items from **Repository Used Book Collection** or **PublicationSG** (under Library)

As these items are not physically stored in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, **a reservation must be made in order to access these materials.**[^1] Items will be made available for on-site consultation for a period of 2-3 weeks. Further instructions will be emailed to you upon a successful reservation. **Please note that the reservation fee will still be charged for any uncollected items.**

The **Repository Used Book Collection** includes items which are the last copies of titles in NLB's collection, out of print titles, materials with research value or historical value, and titles used less frequently although still relevant to Singapore, Southeast Asia and Asia. You may find out more [here](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/SearchDiscover/Services/ResearchServices/RepositoryUsedBookCollection.aspx).

**PublicationSG** is the National Library's collection of our nation's published heritage. These are materials collected through the Legal Deposit statutory function of the National Library Board. These items can only be retrieved for on-site consultation if there are no other loan or reference copies available in NLB's catalogue. You may find out more [here](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/SearchDiscover/Services/ResearchServices/PublicationSG.aspx).
