## **What is OneSearch?**

OneSearch is an online search portal that helps you find information across a variety of resources from the National Library Board (NLB)'s libraries and archives databases as well as National Heritage Board (NHB)’s museum repository of artefacts and artworks. It can retrieve a wide range of digital content such as books, magazines, audio-visual materials, eBooks, photographs, films, oral history interviews and maps residing in the NLB's libraries and archives databases and NHB’s repository.
