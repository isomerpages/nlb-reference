## <u>Introduction</u>

The Cold War refers to the post World War II hostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States that eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Throughout the 45-year period, although no real battles were fought between the two superpowers, there was a threat of nuclear war on both sides, participation by proxy in the wars of their allied countries, a race for supremacy in space exploration, intense missile and nuclear weapon rivalry and economic competition in the form of American capitalism vs. Soviet communism.

This resource guide is not meant to be a comprehensive resource on the Cold War. Rather, it aims to provide an overview of the events leading up to the Cold War, the impact it created within and outside of Europe and how it was eventually resolved.

### <u>Origins of the Cold War</u>

Events leading up to the Cold War began when the alliance between the Soviet Union and its World War II allies, United States, France and Britain broke down in the years immediately after the war. Besides the clash in the diametrically opposing communist and democratic forms of government, Russia’s expansionist ambition to conquer the whole of Europe, beginning with setting up communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia) raised alarms among the Western democratic countries, who perceived Stalin and his ideology as threats to democracy. America and Russia also disagreed over the issue of nuclear weapons disarmament.

The Truman Doctrine, released on March 12, 1947, approving US$400 million to be given to Greece and Turkey to aid their fight against communism, signaled a formal declaration of Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. For the next three decades, America adopted a policy of containment against the Soviet Union, using political, economic and military strategies to stop the spread of communism in Europe and in Southeast Asia. The Soviet Union and its allied communist governments in Europe refused to participate in America’s Marshall Plan (1947), which aimed to provide financial aid to Europe to help them re-build their economies that had been devastated by World War Two.

The Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was another attempt by the Soviet Union to gain control over another European country, Germany, which had been divided into four sectors after World War Two: the French sector, British Sector, American sector and the Soviet sector. This blockade however failed due to the Western allies’ Berlin Airlift operation, which succeeded in providing supplies to people in West Berlin after the Soviet Union had blocked railway and road access to areas under Allied control.

The formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, with the United States pledging her commitment to protect Europe in the event of any attacks, further increased the antagonistic tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both countries intensified the rebuilding of their military forces, which soon escalated to a nuclear arms rivalry, with both countries racing to be the first to develop the most deadly of all bombs – the hydrogen bomb. In response to the Western alliance’s NATO, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance or Warsaw Pact in 1955, a defence strategy joined by eight communist states in Eastern Europe. These two opposing blocs and the continuing rivalry between both countries thus gave shape to the developments of the Cold War.
