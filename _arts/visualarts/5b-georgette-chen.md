### <u>Introduction</u>


Georgette Chen, neé Chang Li Ying, was a Singaporean artist most well-known for her still-life and figure/landscape portraits in oil. She also worked with other mediums such as watercolour and pastels. Chen’s official recognition as a Pioneer Singapore Artist and her being awarded the Cultural Medallion for Fine Art in 1982 testify to her centrality in the development of Singaporean fine art. Chen was born on 1906 in Zhejiang Province, China (erstwhile erroneously assumed to be Paris, France until clarified by Jane Chia through the retrieval of her marriage certificate) and passed away in Singapore on 1993. Her representative works include East Coast Vendor (1961), Self Portrait (c1946), Still Life: Moon Festival Table (c1965) (along with its multiple incarnations), and Lotus in a Breeze (1970), amongst others.

Chen is affiliated with the home-grown ‘Nanyang Art’ movement, retroactively coined by historians Redza Piyadasa and T. K. Sabapathy in 1979, that is characterized in part by a representation of regional and local subject matter via a series of formal aesthetic codes and techniques that synthesize Western and Chinese artistic traditions. At the same time, Chen was also a distinctive case with respect to the Nanyang Art faction—while the rest of her colleagues/ contemporaries, such as Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang, were Chinese émigrés who arrived in Singapore in the 1940s from a war-ravaged China, Chen was primarily educated in Euro-American fine art institutions, from the Art Students League of New York to the Académie Colarossi, and relocated to Singapore by way of Paris, France and Penang, Malaysia a decade later in 1953–54.

Indeed, being born into money, Chen experienced a cosmopolitan and transcontinental childhood and life, traversing nations such as China, France, and the United States for much of her life.

Consequently, her works have been mounted at exhibitions in such diverse locations. For instance, they have been multiply showcased in Paris at various points in her career; her debut featuring a nude study and a painting of the Seine were accepted for exhibition. Subsequently, she has had solo exhibitions in places such as Shanghai (the Metropole Hotel, 1943) and New York (the Asia Institute, 1949). Her first solo exhibition in Singapore was in 1953 at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Chen moved to Singapore permanently from Penang, Malaysia following the dissolution of her second marriage around 1953, and began part-time teaching in fine art at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) from 1954; she was heavily involved in Singaporean artistic circles and life at NAFA from the inception of her tenure at the institution. Her nom de plume, Chendana (Malay for sandalwood, a tree native to tropical Southeast Asia), articulates her sense of attachment to her adopted homeland. She acquired Singaporean citizenship upon Singapore’s separation and independence from Malaysia in 1965.

In recognition of her efforts and achievements toward the enrichment/maturation of the Singaporean art scene, Chen was awarded the prestigious Cultural Medallion (Fine Art) in 1982. A retrospective exhibition was held in her honour at the National Museum in 1985, wherein over 170 of her works were mounted. Chen passed away in 1993 at the Mount Alvernia Hospital, Singapore. 53 of her works were donated to the National Museum, and today, her works are exhibited in major collections such as the Singapore Art Museum and the National Gallery. Chen’s legacy in the Singaporean cultural imaginary is further evidenced in the multiple creative works inspired by her—playwright Ng Yi-Sheng’s musical, Georgette, staged for the 2007 edition of the Singaporean Arts Festival by Musical Theatre Limited; illustrator Sonny Liew’s Chen-inspired graphic novel published in 2014; and the National Gallery-commissioned series of docudramas on her in 2015.
