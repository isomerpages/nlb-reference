### <u>Introduction</u>

Since Europe entered the nineteenth century, the meaning of the ‘modern’ itself has been a constant point of contention in art-historical and scholarly discourse. This has certainly been no less true in Singapore and Asia at large, where what ‘modern’ and ‘modernism’ designate are further complicated by larger issues such as the history of European colonialism, the emergence of the nation-state as a new mode of structuring the world, postcolonial awareness, and so on. In short, ‘modernism’ and the ‘modern’ remain complex and contentious, particularly so in the Asian continent. Indeed, as Low Sze Wee and Shabbir Mustafa tell us, curators and art practitioners intensely debated about “the topic of ‘modernism’ in Singapore, ranging from what definitions, terminologies, and technologies one may adopt to whether there is a specific story to be narrated about the ‘modern’ in Singapore” (p. 8; see entry under Books, Book Chapters, and Exhibition Catalogues) in the formation of Siapa nama kamu?: Art in Singapore since the 19th Century, which is arguably one of the most significant exhibitions at the National Gallery on Singaporean art to date.

It is therefore important to recognize that Asian ‘modernism’ and the Asian ‘modern’ are not merely imported terms that mimic what they indexed in the West, even if they did originate from there. It is more productive to consider modernism and modernity as plural terms that surface variously around the world—modernisms and modernities. To put it otherwise, these terms were transformed and reshaped when they travelled into Asia, where they assumed new characteristics and guises. Low and Mustafa further inform us that a renowned Singaporean curator, Constance Sheares, reinvented the ‘white-cube aesthetic’ that characterizes galleries of modern art when she reproduced it in Singapore for Singaporean art, demonstrating how “\[de\]context\[ualization\] met content in a manner that was new” (p.10; emphasis added) here in Southeast Asia.

Twentieth-century modern(ist) art in Singapore was mainly concerned with imagining the ‘local’ and asserting an indigenous identity through aesthetic material that distinctively represents Singapore and the region, such as the Singapore River or even native produce like tropical fruits. This distinguished modernist Singaporean art from Western High modernist art. One of the defining schools or movements of modernist Singaporean art was the Nanyang Style championed by Nanyang Academy of the Fine Arts (NAFA) practitioners (the ‘Nanyang Artists’), which flourished during the 1950s. These artists synthesized the many aesthetic traditions they were formally trained in—from Chinese/East Asian art to the School of Paris—to produce an artistic canon that is clearly Singaporean. Elsewhere, Chinese ink and calligraphic artists such as Chua Ek Kay and Lim Tze Peng also reinvented the practice, reshaping it as a uniquely local tradition. A similar phenomenon occurred with regard to watercolour painting by artists such as Chen Chong Swee.

The ‘localization’ of the modern was further enriched by several key events and conditions, one of which was the historic 1952 Bali field trip undertaken by pioneer artists Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, and Cheong Soo Pieng, who aspired to recruit Bali as a rich visual resource. Unlike the way in which Euro-American artists approached the ‘East’ as an exotic and foreign Oriental space, these Singaporean artists had a much more nuanced and complicated relationship with Indonesia, our regional neighbour—for them, Bali was not simply a land of exotica, but also one that they personally identified with as part of a regionalist Nanyang Culture. It has also been noted that at least during the mid-twentieth century, modernist Singaporean art was dominated by Chinese artists at the expense of ethnic minority individuals, which summoned issues of ethnic representation and Singaporean multiculturalism that do not appear in discussions of the ‘modern’ and ‘modernism’ elsewhere in the world.

To construct some parameters for this resource guide, we define ‘modern Singaporean art’ as chiefly fine/visual art produced during late-nineteenth century and twentieth century Singapore. However, given the range of meanings and associations that can be ascribed to the ‘modern’ across different spaces and different periods, we also use the term here as an inadvertently open-ended frame of reference; as such, we also include further resources on Singaporean art from before and after this time period to demonstrate that modern Singaporean art can be located within a larger historical continuum, and that the distinctions between the ‘pre-modern,’ ‘modern,’ and ‘post-modern’ can occasionally be blurred.

Published to commemorate the opening of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), this text obtains as the “first foray into investigating and making meaning of the development of modern art in Southeast Asia from the perspective of insiders,” as its blurb discloses.

Extended from a lecture by respected local art historian T. K. Sabapathy, this is an instrumental and timely examination of the significations and coming-into-being of the ‘modern’ in Singaporean and regional art through the development and decline of art history, research, and education in the nation. As an interesting and deeply personal account that references Sabapathy’s transcontinental career and traversals, it connects modern Singaporean art to a larger transnational politics and calls attention to how the canon is also imparted by wider, global conditions.

Call no.: RSING q709.5957 TAN
An academic exercise that extensively investigates the Nanyang School, arguably the first recognizable fine art movement that characterized- if not dominated- modern Singaporean art and which continues to inform the local art-world today. Tan undertakes a transnational approach that retrieves the cosmopolitan registers of the Nanyang Art Style and its émigré practitioners, thus illuminating the complex interface between global and local modernisms/modernities, from Chinese political concerns to formal Western art strategies, in the formulation and emergence of an ‘indigenous’ artistic identity.
