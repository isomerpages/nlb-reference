# Selective Listing of Free Web Design Websites  

One of the most crucial parts of any business is its website. Allowing your customers to navigate through your website with ease and purpose will reflect on your business positively, while an aesthetic looking site will only draw in more people. When building a website, you should take note of the following: design, domain, hosting, and e-commerce. With an abundance of free website builders available, discover our top picks for you to set up your online presence with little cost and effort. 

This is a compilation of some resources on web design websites available from the Internet and is not meant to be exhaustive. 

## List of resources 

### 1.  Wix 

Wix is one of the easiest web builders available, perfect for beginners with no experience in web design. Wix offers many template choices and designs, with even more available at extra cost. A free Wix website will display a Wix banner advertisement, and “Wix” will be included in the domain name. Both features can be removed with a paid plan, and e-commerce transactions can only be made via a paid plan.

### 2.  Weebly 


Weebly offers a free plan that is just enough for small businesses starting out. Its website builder is user-friendly, especially if you don’t feel particularly comfortable with designing one from scratch, and Weebly offers a free Weebly domain with free website hosting. E-commerce transactions are possible with a free plan, but you may need to pay transaction fees for this feature.

### 4.  GoDaddy 
    


If you’re looking to build a basic website quickly, GoDaddy can produce one for you after you have answered just three questions. If you want a more personal touch, the website can be further customised, and you can also optimise your site for mobile viewing. A free GoDaddy site will display a bottom banner advertisement, and “GoDaddy” will be included in the domain name. Both features can be removed with a paid plan.

### 5.  WordPress 
    


With dozens of free themes to choose from and basic customisation options, WordPress has long been a top choice for creating free websites. Although a free WordPress site will also display advertisements and display a branded domain, e-commerce transactions are possible with the free plan through a plugin.
