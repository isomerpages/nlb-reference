# A Selective Listing of Co-working spaces in Singapore 

 

Co-working spaces are shared office spaces which are designed to accommodate people who are freelancers, self-employed or from different companies and professions who need to work on independent projects or require a venue for collaborative huddles. Such spaces are equipped with office equipment, desks, chairs, Internet access and communal facilities such as meeting rooms, breakout spaces and a kitchenette or refreshment area. Some of the benefits of using a co-working space include increasing opportunities for networking and collaboration, boosting productivity levels, igniting creative juices, promoting cost-savings and offering greater flexibility. 

 

This is a select list of co-working spaces for rental in Singapore which may be useful for entrepreneurial start-ups, remote-working or hot-desking.
