# A Selective List of Sites Providing Royalty-Free Music  

Royalty-free refers to a type of music licensing that allows the licensee to use a work without owning the copyright or having to pay the copyright-owner royalties on a pay-per-use basis. This does not mean the music is cost-free; rather, it means that the licensee makes a one-off purchase for the music license and is able to use the music as long as desired.  

This is a list of sites providing royalty-free music available from the Internet and is not meant to be exhaustive.
