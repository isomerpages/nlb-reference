Sustainable living involves making deliberate choices to reduce individual and collective environmental impact in the hope that future generations will be able to inherit a safe and healthy planet. As the earth's resources are finite, it is crucial to reduce one's carbon footprint by using the earth's natural resources economically and minimising the production of waste, pollution and greenhouse gases.

A circular economy approach is often proposed as a means to both promote economic development and environmental sustainability. It is an economic model where materials are reused, remanufactured, recycled or recovered for as long as possible and waste generation is significantly curtailed. [^2]

There are many ways to live sustainably, such as making conscious decisions about how home appliances are used, the kind of products purchased, the type of food consumed and modes of transport used. Living sustainably not only helps to improve the well-being of our planet but also has tremendous health benefits when humans rely less on vehicles, become physically more active and consume better quality foods grown organically and locally.
