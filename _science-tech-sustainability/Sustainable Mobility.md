<p>Four Conversations is an annual signature programme by the National Library
where thought leaders share new possibilities for the future, while inspiring
lifelong learning and the creation of new knowledge.</p>
<p>This resource guide has been produced to complement the conversation on
Sustainable Mobility.</p>
<p>The speakers for the topic “Sustainable Mobility” are:</p>

<p>Dr Lynette Cheah
<br>Associate Professor of Engineering Systems, SUTD (Singapore)</p>
<p>This session was moderated by <strong>Dr Limin Hee</strong>, Director at
the Centre for Liveable Cities.</p>
<p>Transport is one of the main contributors to emissions, noise pollution
and climate change. Privately-owned, fossil fuel cars use hundreds of times
more raw material than their battery electric equivalents. [^2] They exacerbate
transport problems including congestion, air pollution and urban space
deficiency. The challenge of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and dealing
with other sustainable issues calls for a change of the current mobility
system.</p>
<p>Smart mobility provides sustainable mobility and involves various innovations
in information and communication technologies, ranging from high-tech solutions
to data communication and software applications. [^3] Such innovations
enable a shift towards a more service-based mobility system, which makes
urban transport more sustainable and environment friendly. Trends indicate
a shift of ownership towards accessibility as well as the emergence of
shared forms of mobility like ride-sharing and bike-sharing. Smart mobility
also powers the development of automated mobility ranging from driving
assistance to autonomously driving vehicles. The combination of the electrification
of mobility, shared mobility, and automated mobility gives rise to the
development of shared, autonomous, electric vehicles (SAEVs). SAEVs are
expected to play a significant part in the transformation of the transport
system. [^3] Singapore is poised to become the global hub for autonomous
transport technologies and a leader in the global smart mobility market.
