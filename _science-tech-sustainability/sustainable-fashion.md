Sustainable fashion has been gaining traction in recent years with consumers shifting their purchasing decisions to create a cleaner environment through the garments they purchase and wear.[^1] Consumers are now more aware of their purchases, caring not only about the quality and style of their clothing purchases but also the entire life cycle of the garment including the supply chain involved in producing the clothes and the afterlife of the clothing.[^2]<br>

A major opposing force to a sustainable fashion industry is the ‘fast fashion’ phenomena – clothes that are made cheaply and rapidly to meet demands for the ever-changing fashion trends around the world. Across the globe, companies and countries have been taking different approaches to reduce the impact of fashion on the environment and society.[^3] <br> <br>
