Food plays a major role in our lives and food sustainability has gained greater traction in recent years. Food systems account for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions per year, and while two-thirds of food system emissions stem from agriculture and land use, this growing figure also includes emissions from retail, packaging, transport, and processing. [^1] Food waste also plays a major role in filling up landfills and releasing greenhouse gases. In Singapore alone, food waste accounts for 11 percent of the total waste generated per year. [^2] Several factors including an increased demand for food due to a growing global population, overexploitation of natural resources, adverse climate change effects, and food waste, undermine global food security and food sustainability. [^3] However, consumers are also paying more attention to food that is sustainably produced. This is becoming more evident through the rise of sustainable cuisine, local food supply, and even urban farming in Singapore. [^4]
