### <u>Introduction</u>

Seow Poh Leng (萧保龄; 1883–1942) was a prominent banker and one of the founding pioneers of Ho Hong Bank, which later merged with two other banks to form the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation. His father, Seow Chye Watt, was a Hokkien who migrated to Singapore from Malacca. After passing the Senior Cambridge examination at Anglo Chinese School (ACS), Seow became a teacher and taught at Eastern School, ACS and Raffles Institution.

Seow was also a chemist’s assistant, law clerk, stockbroker, insurance agent with Great Eastern Life Assurance Company Limited, clerk at John Little & Company and even dabbled in the rice trading business before he joined banking a.  Seow first joined Chinese Commercial Bank but subsequently left to co-establish the Ho Hong Bank in 1917 with Hokkien merchant Lim Peng Siang and well-known public figure Lim Boon Keng.   Ho Hong Bank became an important foreign exchange bank in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Malaya but subsequently suffered losses due to the Great Depression in the 1930s. On 31 October 1932, the bank merged with Oversea-Chinese Bank and Chinese Commercial Bank to form Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (now known as OCBC Bank).

In his pastime, Seow was an avid theatre lover and took part in many amateur theatricals. He named his seaside bungalow in Siglap “Titania”, and his house at 117 Emerald Hill Road “Oberon” named after characters in Shakespeare’s Midsummer’s Night Dream. Seow was also active in clubs and sports and held several appointments in clubs and associations, such as the honorary secretary of the Straits Chinese Recreation Club in 1905, honorary secretary and treasurer of the Singapore and South Malaya Boy Scouts Association, and vice-president of the Tanjong Katong Swimming Party.
