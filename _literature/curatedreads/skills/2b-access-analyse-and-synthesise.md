**CORE READ**

| ![Craft of research image](/images/literature/curatedreads/skills/Craft-of-research.jpg) | **Craft of Research** <br><br> Call no.: 001.42 BOO <br><br> We all have moments when we simply have no idea how to start preparing a research paper. Fret no more, as this book helps you along with useful and effective tips. <br><br> Chapter 9 is particularly important as it provides a guide on how to assemble reasons and evidence to support your argument. As the author explains below, supporting your argument with a clear and logical order of reasons and evidence is crucial to any research. Without such support, it is likely your research will be rejected by any reader. | 

_"Readers look first for the core of an argument, a claim and its support. They look particularly at its set of reasons to judge its plausibility and their order to judge its logic. If they think those reasons make consecutive sense, they will look for evidence they rest on, the bedrock of every argument. If they don't believe the evidence, they'll reject the reasons, and along with them the claim. So as you assemble the core of your argument, you must offer the reader a plausible set of reasons, in clear, logical order, based on evidence they will accept. (p. 130)"_
