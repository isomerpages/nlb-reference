**Quiet: The Power of Introverts**

Call no.: 155.232 CAI

In a world where extroversion is celebrated as an ideal personality trait, the quiet talents of introverts often go unnoticed. Drawing on psychological research, personal experiences, and even brain chemistry, Susan Cain reveals the strengths of introversion and the place of introverts in culture and society.

Chapter 10 is particularly insightful as it provides tips on how extroverts and introverts can communicate with each other, while Chapter 5 is a must-read for introverts who struggle with public-speaking. As the author writes:

_"It's so easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent. Someone seems like a good presenter, easy to get along with, and those traits are rewarded. Well, why is that? They're valuable traits, but we put too much of a premium on presenting and not enough on substance and critical thinking."_
