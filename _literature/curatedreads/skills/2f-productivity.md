According to SPRING Singapore, productivity is a measure of the effectiveness and efficiency of an organisation in generating output with the resources available. As a result, raising workplace productivity will not only increase and improve the utilisation of an organisation's resources, but also enhance its long-term competitiveness and profitability. However, many considerations are needed before a high level of productivity can be instilled in the workplace. These include better working relations among workers, higher investment in capital and optimal use of capital. Here are some resources to help you make the first step.

| ![Smarter faster better image](/images/literature/curatedreads/skills/Smarter-faster-better-350X552.jpg) | **Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business** <br><br> Call no.: 158 DUH <br><br>This is a fascinating book that explores the science of productivity, and why, in today's world, managing how you think—rather than what you think—can transform your life. |

_"productivity isn't about working more or sweating harder. It's not simply a product of spending longer hours at your desk or making bigger sacrifices. Rather, productivity is about making certain choices in certain ways. The way we choose to see ourselves and frame daily decisions; the stories we tell ourselves, and the easy goals we ignore; the sense of community we build among teammates; the creative cultures we establish as leaders: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive."_

At the core of Smarter Faster Better are eight key concepts—from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision-making—that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology and behavioural economics—as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals FBI agents, pilots, and Broadway songwriters—this book unveils insights into the habits of the most productive people, companies and organisations.
