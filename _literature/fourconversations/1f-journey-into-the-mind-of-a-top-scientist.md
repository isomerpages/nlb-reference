_This resource guide was one of the four produced for “Four Conversations: New Thinking for a New World”. Organised by the National Library, the event was held on 3 and 4 June 2017. This guide accompanied the talk given by Professor Robert Root-Bernstein on the topic “Creativity as an Essential Skill for Future-Readiness”._

### <u>Introduction</u>

**The speaker for the topic is Professor Sir David Lane, Chief Scientist from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.**

| Sir David Lane is one of the scientists credited with the landmark discovery of cancer gene p53 in 1979. p53, called the “Guardian of the genome”, is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer as more than half of human tumours contain such alterations. <br><br> He was previously the Director of the Cancer Research UK Cell Transformation Research Group and Professor of Oncology at the University of Dundee in Scotland. He had also held the position of Chief Scientist with Cancer Research UK and was the Scientific Director of the Ludwig Institute. <br><br> Sir David is currently Chief Scientist of Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research and Chairman of Chugai Pharmbody Research Pte Ltd, which he helped to attract to Singapore. CPR represents a $400 million 10-year investment by Chugai in research located in the Synapse building at the Biopolis, Singapore. The company currently employs over 90 highly qualified researchers developing new antibody therapeutics. <br><br> For his efforts in cancer research, Sir David was knighted in 2000.  He also received the Cancer Research UK Lifetime Achievement Award – a prize that recognises his pioneering research that led to the discovery of p53. | ![David lane image](/images/literature/fourconversations/David-Lane.jpg) |
