GIC group president and former civil service head, Lim Siong Guan, spoke on honour, wealth, leadership and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy as keys to Singapore’s success. Singapore’s success in the last 50 years has been the result of human imagination and hard work, as well as the courage to be different and unique. These have been founded on honour, integrity and trust that the people of Singapore will do what is good and right for themselves, their families and their society.

This article describes Public Service for the 21st century, or PS21 ̶ a programme focused on adapting Singapore’s public service to the needs of the 21st century against the backdrop of the country’s recent history such as challenges posed by the island’s small size, sudden independence and multiracial population. The ability to sustain four decades of economic adaptation and public service adjustment is seen to be intimately linked with the goals of governance and the quality of leadership in the Republic.
