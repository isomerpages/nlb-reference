### <u>Introduction</u>

Youths-at-risk are in danger of becoming delinquent, dropping out of school, or engaging in undesirable activities. Any of these will impact their lives, now and in future. Counselling youths before they fall into this category is critical at a juncture when they are under immense peer pressure, puberty, and academic stress. If they do act on impulse, misbehave, or even worse commit a crime, it is especially important to manage them correctly and with their future development in mind. Everybody, from the parent to the school and the justice system, has to play a part to ensure they remain responsible, understanding and productive members of society.

The 20 titles in this resource guide are listed alphabetically and cover various topics such as youth mental health, substance abuse and juvenile justice.
