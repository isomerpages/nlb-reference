In response to COVID-19, many schools across the globe have closed and transitioned to home-based learning (HBL), or distance learning, affecting over 90 percent of the world’s student population.[^1] 

Distance or online learning is not new to the education sector, especially with the rising popularity of massive open online courses (MOOC) in the past decade and the integration of technology in the classroom.[^2] However, the current duration and scale of HBL is an unprecedented one for students, teachers and families alike, and is part of a wider crisis management.[^3]

Observations during this HBL period across the world include the impact of socio-economic factors on accessibility to learning, developments in technology to support the needs of differently-abled learners, and alternative modes of assessment for students.[^4]

The lessons learnt from the current COVID-19 crisis may chart new directions for the education landscape in Singapore and the rest of world. To find out more about HBL and online learning, check out the resources below.
