The COVID-19 pandemic has radically shifted the learning experience on an unprecedented scale. While online internet access and technology tools provide a seemingly convenient solution to transition from onsite and face-to-face interaction to a virtual learning environment, the current situation has revealed the lack of these facilities and other digital barriers in many communities worldwide, including Singapore. 

In a 2019 survey conducted by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, 98% of households in Singapore with school-going children enjoy computer access at home and nearly 100% of them have home internet access.[^1] This means that every young learner has the capability to go online, accessing new ways to learn without the physical presence of an educator or trainer. However, the reality is that some communities do not have access to digital tools or conducive spaces necessary for digital learning.[^2] 

Big Data and machine learning have augmented teaching, allowing course content to adapt to individual needs and proficiencies. Web-based learning tools within the learning space such as virtual classrooms also aid in engaging students and instilling a sustained interest in learning. New multimedia and interactive tools such as games or simulations have provided both schools and workplaces with novel ways to deliver content, and for learners to experience knowledge differently. For the working community, there are numerous avenues to learn and upskill with professional courses available in online and digital formats and multiple ways to learn, experience and practice course content.

How effective technology is on the learning experience in terms of its role in reinforcing human connections and social interactions is also an important consideration when assessing its impact.[^3]

UNESCO reports that school closures due to COVID-19 has resulted in remote and virtual learning for primary and secondary school students worldwide. However, a large number of them do not have the required infrastructure and equipment. It adds that alternative measures such as using existing community radio and televisions and appropriate training for teachers to conduct such long-distance learning is important to ensure that learning is not disrupted during this period.
