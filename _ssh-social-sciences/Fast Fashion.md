<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>“Fast fashion,” a term used to describe inexpensive and widely-available
“in the moment” garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of
clothing. By making available large quantities of clothing at throwaway
prices, fast fashion has emerged as a dominant business model, causing
garment consumption to soar. While this trend may be considered as the
“democratisation” of fashion in which the latest styles are available to
all classes of consumers, the human and environmental health risks associated
with fast fashion are said to be hidden throughout the life-cycle of each
piece of clothing.</p>
<p>Fast fashion’s speedy supply chains rely on outsourced and often underpaid
labour from factory workers overseas, and the process is environmentally
damaging and resource-intensive. Critics claim that the “blindingly fast
pace at which fast fashion clothes are manufactured, worn and discarded
means that they have become more disposable, more commodities than keepsakes,
and shoppers are essentially conditioned to expect a constant stream of
new items.”</p>
<p>This resource guide shines the spotlight on the phenomenon of fast fashion,
why it is so popular, its environmental impacts, and alternative fashion
trends that counter it.</p>

<h5><strong>Ultra fast-fashion is eating the world</strong></h5>
<p>Even during the COVID-19 pandemic with the world economy taking a massive
hit, demand for “cheap, cute clothes” is said to have persisted. While
the rest of the retail sector struggled, a new cohort of companies such
as Boohoo and Asos, known as ultra-fast fashion, thrived. Asos’ sales rose
rapidly from March to June 2020 and Boohoo was reported to have had its
“best quarter ever.” These companies leveraged digital platforms to fulfill
their customers’ demand for fast fashion.</p>

<h5><strong>Why professional women are breaking up with fast fashion</strong></h5>
<p>With the killing of over 1,000 factory workers in the Rana Plaza clothing
factory in Bangladesh in 2013, professional women have started wondering
about the true cost of making fast fashion clothes. Many fast fashion brands
outsource their production overseas where garments are produced with unfair
pay and poor work conditions. Professional women who support sustainability
are reported to have now turned to circular fashion, a system in which
articles are circulated and reused for as long as they can be, before being
decomposed safely.</p>

<h5><strong>Fast fashion is on the rampage, with the UK at the head of the charge</strong></h5>
<p>Fashion consumers in the United Kingdom are reported to be among the most
voracious in the world. One in three young women, the largest segment of
consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers
sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfills in
2018.</p>

<h5><strong>The true cost of fast fashion</strong></h5>
<p>Fast fashion allows consumers to buy more clothes, but they are wearing
them less often and disposing of them at an unprecedented rate. Millions
of tonnes of clothes are reported to be ending up in landfills every year.
This video takes a look at how the fashion industry can continue to grow
while addressing the environmental need for people to buy fewer clothes.</p>

are made, and where they ultimately end up.”</p>

“early majority”, “late majority”, and “laggards”. This research finds
that perceptions of fast-fashion vary across different consumer adoption
groups in terms of “being in-style products”, “expressing self-image”,
“imitating luxury fashion products”, and “frequent renewal of collections”.</p>

to have recognised that “fashion’s centre of gravity has shifted, and have
found a way to capitalise on it.”</p>

<h5><strong>Is slow fashion the new luxury? If fast fashion defined the 2010s, slow fashion may be the marker of the new decade</strong></h5>
<p>For years, the fashion industry is said to have pushed mass production
and consumption so rapidly that, “quick-turn, quick-churn fashion is now
falling out of favour and making way for its more measured counterpart.”
The COVID-19 pandemic is seen to have helped foster a “buy less, buy better
mentality with interest sparking in products with more value and longevity
compared to disposable fast fashion.”</p>

<h5><strong>The global environmental injustice of fast fashion</strong></h5>
<p>This paper posits that while fast fashion offers consumers an opportunity
to buy more clothes for less, those who work in or live near textile manufacturing
facilities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health hazards.
Furthermore, increased consumption patterns are also said to have created
millions of tonnes of textile waste in landfills and unregulated settings.</p>

<p>This book traces the life-cycle of a pair of jeans. Raw materials from
a Texas cotton farm are sent for dyeing and weaving to factories in China,
and then sewn in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, before being transported back
to the United States. The jeans’ journey usually ends in a landfill in
Africa. The book sheds light on the hazards posed by fast fashion and how
the "trend-based aesthetic of celebrity/influencer culture" has contributed
to the rise of disposable fashion.</p>
