### <u>Introduction</u>

Board members are the fiduciaries who steer the organisation towards a sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical and legal governance and financial management policies as well as by making sure the organisation has adequate resources to advance its mission. The director/executive compensation environment continues to evolve and the benchmarked best practices continue to change. Besides pay and salary, there are many variables that determine director/executive compensation such as number of yearly meetings, industry, business size, business structure, company rules and regulations, improved incentive designs which ensure greater pay-for-performance alignment and communications and interests of investors and other stakeholders on public trust of compensation outcomes.

This guide provides recommended resources on the topic of role of boards in setting executive director’s compensation that are available from NLB as well as on the Internet. As the guide is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources.

Clifford examines how board directors and compensation committees have directly contributed to the rising salaries and bonuses of executives. He questions the wisdom of an out-of-control bonus system that limits an organisation’s progress or induces a CEO to act in a way that may be in conflict with a company’s best interests. Instead, he advocates replacing an annual bonus with restricted stock, making the CEO a shareholder with a vested interest in the organisation’s success. Other recommendations include prohibiting CEOs from also being board chairpersons, linking pay to internal equity and instituting a luxury tax on excess compensation.
