The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the sports and fitness industry and severely impacted the staging of sporting events around the world.

Virtually every major sporting event – from football, baseball and rugby leagues to aquatics competitions, horseracing and indoor sports tournaments such as darts and snooker – has been cancelled or postponed. Even the Tokyo Olympic Games, which was slated to start on 24 July this year, has been postponed to 23 July 2021 instead, with the Paralympic Games similarly postponed to 24 August 2021.[^1] 

In a bid to curb the spread of the virus among the community, sporting venues and facilities such as gyms, sports stadiums and swimming pools have been shuttered in many countries.[^2] 

Singapore has also closed all sports and recreation facilities from 7 April 2020 to comply with safe distancing measures implemented as a circuit breaker to minimise further spread of COVID-19.[^3] In response, Sport Singapore (SportSG), the national body promoting sports in Singapore, has encouraged people to continue exercising to stay healthy and boost their immunity.[^4]

The pandemic has been a big blow to the global sports industry financially, in terms of lost revenues for the athletes, leagues, sports organisations, staff hired to work at sporting events, ticket sales and television contracts. In Singapore, the cancellation of sports competitions due to the pandemic, leading to the loss of event and sponsorship revenue (SGD $1.8 million in 2018) would potentially mean a 20 percent loss of its annual revenue for a national sports association such as The Swimming Association.[^5]

With the COVID-19 pandemic upsetting fitness routines and social distancing becoming the new normal, many have turned to the Internet for help to get their endorphin fix. Fitness trainers, gyms and studios have deftly tapped into this need by providing a smorgasbord of pre-recorded or livestreamed online workout classes to suit varying fitness abilities and exercise preferences.[^6]

Some countries have slowly begun to ease out of their nationwide-imposed lockdowns but in the new normal, sports competitions and matches will be played in empty sports venues. Players must undergo regular COVID-19 tests and safe distancing guidelines strictly adhered to for the foreseeable future. Professional football teams in Austria have already re-started training for the new football season and the German Bundesliga has sprung back into action after a 61-day hiatus. Over in South Korea, the professional baseball and pro soccer leagues have similarly been revived. Plans for sports such as basketball, rugby, cricket and ice hockey to resume in other countries are also being mapped out.[^7]
