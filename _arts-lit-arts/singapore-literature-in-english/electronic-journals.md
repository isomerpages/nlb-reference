### **Overview of the Singapore Literature Bibliographies (1950 – 2015)**

The National Library has compiled a set of bibliographies on Singapore Literature that covers works published in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. These provide a comprehensive listing of literary works by Singapore writers and Singapore literature from more than 50 years ago. The bibliographies have been updated from the original print versions to include works published from 2008 to 2015. The full listing of works including titles of newspapers and literary periodicals in the four languages can be easily accessed through the Resource Guides platform. More information about the specific language bibliographies including scope and coverage can be found in the respective Singapore Literature Resource Guides.

**Singapore Literature in English**

Singapore Literature in English forms an indispensable part of our culture and identity. Whether writing on public or private themes, the stories, poems and plays give expression to the nation’s and individual’s consciousness, imagination and experience. They enrich our lives by engaging and challenging us with the issues that they present, and by delighting and stirring us with the power and beauty of language and expressions.

**Electronic Journals**

While Singapore currently lacks a nationally or internationally established print literary journal or review devoted to literature, literary criticism and reviews, the entries below list online journals that attempt to fill the gap left by a paucity of print journals devoted to Singapore literature in English. Like print versions, these electronic journals  are potentially transient, hence, entries are updated regularly to replace defunct ones.
