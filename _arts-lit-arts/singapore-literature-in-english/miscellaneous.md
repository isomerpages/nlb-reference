### Overview of the Singapore Literature Bibliographies (1950 – 2015)

The National Library has compiled a set of bibliographies on Singapore Literature that covers works published in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. These provide a comprehensive listing of literary works by Singapore writers and Singapore literature from more than 50 years ago. The bibliographies have been updated from the original print versions to include works published from 2008 to 2015. The full listing of works including titles of newspapers and literary periodicals in the four languages can be easily accessed through the Resource Guides platform. More information about the specific language bibliographies including scope and coverage can be found in the respective Singapore Literature Resource Guides.

**Singapore Literature in English**

Singapore Literature in English forms an indispensable part of our culture and identity. Whether writing on public or private themes, the stories, poems and plays give expression to the nation’s and individual’s consciousness, imagination and experience. They enrich our lives by engaging and challenging us with the issues that they present, and by delighting and stirring us with the power and beauty of language and expressions.

### <u>Accessing National Library Board Singapore Resources</u>

**Accessing the Print Materials**

You can search the library catalogue (for physical materials) in the library and from home (http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg). The easy search function allows you to search/browse by author, title, keyword, subject and ISBN/ISSN whereas the advanced search allows you to narrow your searches to specific media types or language holdings. In both instances, you will also be able to limit your search to specific libraries by clicking on the “limit by branch” option.

**To search Lee Kong Chian Reference Library’s Holdings**

If you wish to search for only materials available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, please always click on the “Limit by Branch” button at the bottom of the page, after you have keyed in your search term. This brings you to a new page whereby you will be able to select the library of your choice. Choose “Lee Kong Chian Reference Library” and select “yes” under the “Display only items available in the selected branch below” and then click on search.

**Things to note:**
