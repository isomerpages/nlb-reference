description: Launched to celebrate Singapore’s 50th birthday in 2015, the
  project set out to digitise five decades of Singapore Tamil literary
  treasures—including novels, short stories, poems, and plays. By converting
  physical books into accessible digital formats, the project has created a
  valuable and readily available resource of local Tamil literature, preserving
  the rich cultural heritage for future generations.
