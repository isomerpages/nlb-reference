<h1>Digital Archives of Singapore Tamil Literature: 1965-2015</h1>
<p>[Launched on 22 August 2015]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Synopsis</strong></h2>
<p>This initiative marked the first of four community-driven collaborations
between the National Library Board (NLB) and the Tamil Digital Heritage
Group, which later became part of the Centre for Singapore Tamil Culture
in February 2019. Launched to celebrate Singapore’s 50th birthday in 2015,
the project set out to digitise five decades of Singapore Tamil literary
treasures—including novels, short stories, poems, and plays.</p>
<p>By converting physical books into accessible digital formats, the project
has created a valuable and readily available resource of local Tamil literature,
preserving the rich cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
<p>The Tamil Digital Heritage (TDH) working group, made up of dedicated authors,
teachers, and literary enthusiasts, was supported by a team of advisors
who provided guidance throughout the process. Their collective efforts
sparked strong community involvement, rallying over 200 volunteers—including
Tamil language educators, writers (many being the original authors), community
groups, and NLB staff—to carefully annotate, proofread, and test the digital
collection in schools.</p>
<p>This collaboration not only brought the community together but also ensured
that Singapore’s Tamil literary legacy continues to thrive in the digital
age. This archive serves as an educational resource, a reference resource
for scholars, a teaching tool in the classroom, a historical account for
posterity and a contribution to national arts resources.</p>
