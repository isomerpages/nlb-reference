The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the global economy, creating uncertainties in demand and disruptions in global supply chains. These have in turn not only restricted movements of people and materials but also caused delivery delays and shortages of goods and materials. It has been a challenge to keep global supply chains of essential goods open. A stark reminder of this situation came from the World Health Organization (WHO) who warned that disruptions to the supply of personal protective equipment were putting lives at risk.[^1]

Uncertainties and sudden disruptions in the early months of the pandemic have also emphasised the importance of supply chain resilience and risk management.[^2] Countries, including Singapore, have started to develop and strengthen regional supply chains to diversify supply options. Developing and strengthening regional supply chains present opportunities for countries such as Singapore, with its status as a financial and logistical hub, to tap on.[^3]

While optimising supply chains used to focus largely on cost efficiency and commercial outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in this approach and forced a relook into not just supply but demand patterns as well. Companies that have adopted digital technologies, wider global supply-chain networks and multiple distribution channels appear to be more resilient and better responsive to supply-chain disruptions. As a result, there is now a concerted effort for resilience and adaptability as well as developments in technology and sustainability to be factored into global supply chain management.[^4]

Facing the threat of broken supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic, companies have diversified their supply chains at a higher operating cost. The article highlights that a regional supply system would replace the current global model and that competition in emerging industries will become more intense.
