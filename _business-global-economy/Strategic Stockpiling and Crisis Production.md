The importance of strategic stockpiling comes to the forefront when global supply chains and production lines are disrupted during times of crisis. Stockpiling is not only about storing supplies and equipment but a broader consideration of what are the more pressing dangers or threats that may disrupt national economies and livelihoods.[^1]To ensure that food and essential supplies remain available, many countries have built and maintained national stockpiles over the years. For example, this can be seen from strategies deployed by organisations such as the Singapore Food Agency[^2] and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore[^3] to diversify food sources,[^4] the United States’ Strategic National Stockpile[^5] of medical supplies and Finland’s National Emergency Supply Agency which maintains different stockpiles from fuel to medicine and food.[^6] Stockpiling efforts can also be enhanced by
international cooperation. For instance, there are also roadmaps on institutionalised oil stockpiling based on the Energy Cooperation framework of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) + 3 (China, Japan, and the
Republic of Korea).[^7]

Strategic stockpiling and crisis production planning are an ongoing effort as it is not enough to rely on stockpiling or
diversification. As the current pandemic has shown, food production has to continue despite social distancing while increasing demands for medical equipment and drugs must be met. This provides an impetus for industries to innovate and revolutionise production and manufacturing at an accelerated pace, where some of these crisis production models may eventually be converted to new modes of operation.
