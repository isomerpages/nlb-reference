The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the global economy. With varying degrees of lockdowns imposed, both advanced and developing economies have been hit hard as economic activities ground to a halt and livelihoods are drastically affected. The pandemic is also a stark reminder of how interconnected the world’s economies are.

Since the mid-20th century, free trade and technological advancement, among other factors, have removed barriers and borders of many kinds, enabling the seamless movement of people, goods and information across the world. Governments worldwide have increasingly integrated their economies through flows of trade, investment and capital across borders thereby creating a global marketplace.[^1]

However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments, businesses and communities worldwide to reconsider their boundaries. With state borders restricted and the flow of people, goods and services heavily curtailed, there has been a severe disruption to supply chains worldwide.

In the global economy, Singapore has served as a major business and financial hub and benefitted greatly from its economic openness. The nation-state is bound to confront challenges on the economic front due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, Singapore has been working closely with nations across the world to mitigate disruptions to the economy, trade and travel, with the hope that the world will “emerge from the crisis stronger, more interconnected.[^2]”

Check out the resources below to find out more about the interconnectedness of the global economy and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our next guide will look at supply chains in a globalized world.
