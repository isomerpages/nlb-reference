Food logistics or supply and food safety are two major components in ensuring food security. The processes involved in these areas are often taken for granted in our everyday lives. When a crisis strikes, everyone from “farm to fork” is affected, and any potential risk or disruption shines a spotlight on the entire food supply chain.

In 2018 and 2019, Singapore topped the Global Food Security Index of 113 countries, making us one of the most food-secure nations in the world. In contrast, an estimated 820 million people around the world do not have enough to eat as they face challenges such as poverty, lack of agricultural infrastructure and access to essential vitamins and minerals.[^1] However, Singapore imports over 90 percent of our food supply, and is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and prices.[^2] Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed these risks first hand, and experienced the potential disruptions to our everyday lives, from our food and beverage businesses to supermarket shopping.[^3]

Food safety involves the safe preparation, packing and storage of food to prevent biological, chemical and physical contamination.[^5] Such contamination can occur at any point in the food supply chain including at home. According to the World Health Organization, almost 1 in 10 people in the world or an estimated 600 million fall ill after eating contaminated food. Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, parasites or chemical substances causes more than 200 diseases.[^6] Issues such as food fraud through adulteration and tampering, lack of a robust track and trace system and lax food safety standards have adverse effects on food logistics.[^7]

The global food supply chain has become increasingly complex with globalization. Population growth and changes in consumer habits create both opportunities and challenges to food logistics and safety.[^8]

To ensure a constant and reliable food supply and minimise dependency, Singapore imports from varied sources.

Other measures include funding for Singapore companies to set up food production companies overseas and educating the public on alternative food products.

Every year, nearly one in ten people in the world (an estimated 600 million people) fall ill and 420,000 die after eating contaminated food. Unsafe food also hinders development in many low- and middle-income economies, which lose around US$95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability and premature death suffered by workers. World Food Safety Day is a unique opportunity to raise awareness on the dangers of unsafe food and the important role everyone can play in ensuring food safety.
