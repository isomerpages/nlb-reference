# YouTube for Business Start-ups 

Launched in 2005, video streaming platform YouTube is only second to Facebook as the world’s most-used social media platform. YouTube currently has more than 2 billion active users. 

The popularity of YouTube means that businesses can now generate brand awareness, increase customer engagement and bump up conversion rates through interactive videos. YouTube offers users their own channels that they can use to develop and execute their marketing strategies. Companies can also create video advertisements that will play on other channels to reach and promote their products and services to potential customers. 

## Getting started 

Anyone can view videos on YouTube, but an account is needed to upload and share them. Taking advantage of what YouTube offers requires a deep understanding of all its features and functions, which includes optimising your channel, gaining and engaging followers, advertising your brand, and monetising your channel to increase profitability. 

To get started, you’ll need to set up a brand account on YouTube. You should also do some groundwork and learn who your audience is and who your competitors are. You should also check out other videos, especially those that are trending to have an idea of what grabs people’s attention. Learn how to optimise your videos (e.g. having a strong title and writing a keyword rich description) so that they will show up in YouTube’s searches. You should also optimise your channel to attract more viewers.
