## <u>Introduction</u>

Air pollution is the accumulation in the atmosphere of substances that in sufficient concentrations, degrade ecosystems and endanger human health. Most air pollution is caused by human activities, but certain natural processes such as a forest fire can pollute the air.

<b><u>Pollutants and Sources</u></b>

The following substances are common air pollutants:

* Carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas, is produced by the combustion, or burning, of petroleum products, including heating oil, gasoline, and diesel fuel.
* Sulfur oxides (SOx) are gases produced by combustion of fuels that contain sulfur, including coals and high-sulfur petroleum products such as heavy fuel oils, and by industrial smelting plants and facilities that manufacture coke, a form of coal used as fuel in blast furnaces.
* Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, especially gasoline, in automobiles and other vehicles, and in electric power plants.
Small, airborne particles, called particulates or more commonly known as soot, are formed by the combustion of coal, especially by electric power generators and heavy industry. Particulates also form, to a lesser extent, from combustion of diesel fuel and fuel oil by vehicles and heavy industry. Mixtures of gases with extremely small liquid and solid particles are commonly called smoke.
* Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are formed by the evaporation of petroleum-derived chemical products such as gasoline and other fuels, solvents, and oil-based paints. Emissions of unburned fuel by gasoline engines also contribute.
* Airborne lead is emitted in the exhaust of vehicles that burn leaded gasoline and can also be emitted by lead smelters and lead-processing industries. Lead is a gas when it emerges from the combustion chamber, but as it cools it condenses to particle form.
* Ammonia gas occurs in industrial emissions and in the volatile emissions from animal wastes, especially at large animal holding facilities such as feedlots. It may collect as a liquid in the field, feedlot, or lagoon, but it evaporates into a gaseous form, especially on hot days.
* Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are gases that in the past were used as coolants in products such as refrigerators and air conditioners. However, there are still many older air conditioners and refrigerators that contain CFCs.
* Ozone is a gas that is a dangerous pollutant in some situations and is beneficial in others. In the atmosphere, air containing high levels of ozone is harmful to the health, and exposure to such air can damage plants and many materials. Two major sources of ozone pollution are automobiles and electric power plants.

NOx and VOCs also combine to form smog, which appears as a dense haze over a city on hot summer days. SOx and NOx pollutants react with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain. A number of primary pollutants including SOx, NOx and ammonia can condense in the atmosphere to form tiny particulates that eventually fall to the Earth in a process known as deposition.

With the exception of lead and CFCs, all of these compounds also occur as natural constituents of the atmosphere at low concentrations. Natural events or processes that create common pollutants include forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wetlands processes, lightning strikes and the rotting of woodland vegetation (VOCs). Although forest fires and volcanic eruptions can temporarily degrade the local air quality, overall these natural events and processes create far less pollution than modern, human-created technology, especially since the Industrial Revolution.

<b><u>Effects On Humans</u></b>

People experience a wide range of health effects from being exposed to air pollution such as pneumonia or bronchitis, irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Bad smells made by factories, garbage, or sewer systems are considered air pollution, too. These odours are less serious but still unpleasant. Other effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause damage to people’s nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects.

<b><u>Regulation</u></b>

In addition to the international Kyoto Protocol, most developed nations have adopted laws to regulate emissions and reduce air pollution. In the United States, debate is under way about a system called Cap and Trade to limit emissions. This system would cap or place a limit on the amount of pollution a company is allowed. Companies that exceeded their cap would have to pay. Companies that polluted less than their Cap could Trade or sell their remaining pollution allowance to other companies. Cap and Trade would essentially pay companies to limit pollution.

In 2006 the World Health Organization issued new Air Quality Guidelines. The WHOs guidelines are tougher than most individual countries existing guidelines. The WHO guidelines aim to reduce air pollution-related deaths by 15 percent a year.

<b><u>Reduction</u></b>

There are many steps to reduce air pollution such as taking public transportation instead of driving a car, car pool or riding a bike instead of travelling in carbon dioxide-emitting vehicles, avoiding aerosol cans, recycling yard trimmings instead of burning them and not smoking cigarettes.

ASEAN countries have taken ‘green measures’ to improve energy efficiency, promote renewable energy and enhance mitigation and adaptation responses. But as the 2009 ADB report points out, regional cooperation can offer a better means of dealing with cross-boundary issues such as water resource management, marine ecosystems, forest fire prevention, the containment of infectious disease, and disaster and risk management. The sharing of experience, knowledge and information at the regional level can also lead to more innovative and efficient adaptation strategies at the national level.
