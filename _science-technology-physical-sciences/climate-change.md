## Introduction

Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. The global climate is the connected system of sun, earth and oceans, wind, rain and snow, forests, deserts and savannas, and everything people do, too. Changes in the global climate and resultant changes to land areas, oceans and coastal regions impact us and all other living creatures on this planet.

This guide consists of a general list of Internet resources, books and Ebooks about climate change. They are available online and at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.  Readers with an interest in this subject are recommended to search the NLB catalogue or online for more information.

According to Ariana Sutton-Grier, eco-system ecologist and biogeochemist, one frequently ignored climate change solution is to utilise ecosystems that are naturally carbon absorbent, such as saltwater marshes and other coastal environments. Coastal ecosystems store carbon almost entirely below ground and are known to be better carbon sinks than forests.

 

**Strategies for mitigation of climate change: A review** 

Fawzy, S. et al. (2020, November). Strategies for mitigation of climate change: A review. In *Environmental Chemistry Letters*, 18(6), 2069-2094.

A three-prong strategy is needed to tackle climate change - conventional mitigation technologies which focus on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, negative emissions technologies which aim to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon and geoengineering techniques to stablise or reduce global temperatures. The author concludes that biogenic-based sequestration projects are ready to be deployed but efficient carbon pricing mechanisms focusing on carbon removal need to be quickly developed and deployed when ready.

 

**The role of climate change education on individual lifetime carbon emissions**

Cordero, E., Centeno, D. & Todd, A. M. (2020, February). The role of climate change education on individual lifetime carbon emissions. In *PLoS One*, 15(2), 1-23. Retrieved 2021, January 28, from ProQuest Central via NLB’s eResources website [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/){:target="blank"} (*myLibrary ID* is required to access this article)

This paper examines the impact which an intensive one-year university course on individual carbon emissions had on graduates from the course. A survey done five years after the end of the course revealed that graduates made more pro-environmental decisions, resulting in a reduction of individual carbon emissions by 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. The authors conclude that similar education programmes conducted on a wide scale would be equally of not more effective then mitigation strategies such as using solar rooftops or electric vehicles.

According to this report, there is still a long way to go before countries, cities and companies can reach the 2030 and 2050 emissions-reduction targets for the power, buildings, industry, transport, forests and agriculture sectors. Progress is too slow and therefore the share of renewables in electricity generation, electric vehicles adoption and increase in annual tree cover need to be accelerated. There is an urgent need to implement policies, incentives and financial investments to head towards a net-zero emissions future.

This report is the joint collaboration of the United Nations and global scientific partner organisations such as the Global Carbon Project, the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization. It assesses the state of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 and addresses the impact of climate change on land, water, oceans and the cryosphere. Findings show that the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 only temporarily reduced carbon emissions and will not help to slow down the rate of global temperature rise.

Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker and CNN climate analyst, John D. Sutter, talks about his longitudinal film series -- BASELINE, which helps to document climate changes in four different locations at every five-year interval until 2050. This documentary aims to address the "shifting baseline syndrome", which refers to the human perception that environmental change happens too glacially to raise the alarm among the general human population.
