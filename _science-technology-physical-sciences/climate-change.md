## Introduction

![Raffles image](/images/category/singaporeandsoutheastasia/Raffles-in-SEA-pic-1.jpg) 

Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. The global climate is the connected system of sun, earth and oceans, wind, rain and snow, forests, deserts and savannas, and everything people do, too. Changes in the global climate and resultant changes to land areas, oceans and coastal regions impact us and all other living creatures on this planet.

This guide consists of a general list of Internet resources, books and Ebooks about climate change. They are available online and at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.  Readers with an interest in this subject are recommended to search the NLB catalogue or online for more information.
