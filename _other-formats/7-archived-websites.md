# **Ephemera**

Ephemera is a term that refers to items intended for short-term use, such as tickets, pamphlets and brochures. The Lee Kong Chian Reference Library collects a variety of print ephemera, namely leaflets, pamphlets, brochures, information sheets, and other minor documents of a few pages or less. Ephemera are valuable sources containing unique information that can supplement standard reference materials. They are useful to researchers wishing to obtain information on societal, cultural, economic and historical developments.

Our ephemera collection relates mainly to heritage landmarks, organisations and events in Singapore, many of which were issued to promote local cultural events and programmes. When taken in their respective historical contexts, ephemera can reveal much about the culture and society of its time. 

Currently, the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library has about 20,000 ephemera items related to Singapore in our collection, and the highlights in our ephemera collection include the [Lim Shao Bin collection](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204372942), which features ephemera from the Japanese occupation, as well as election brochures from the [2011](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=14283091) and [2015 General Election](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204376658). Ephemera made for local cultural events from several organisations, including [W!ld Rice](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=205261778), [British Council Singapore](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=205262382) and the [Indian Heritage Centre](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=203771151), are also selectively collected.
