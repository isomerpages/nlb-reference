<h1>Archived Social Media</h1>
<p>The National Library is now collecting and preserving social media content.</p>
<p>The social media collection is in the early stages of development and
is not yet available for public access. We welcome the public to contribute
your social media content to be a part of our National Collection.</p>
<h2>Why preserve social media</h2>
<p>Social media has become an integral part of how Singaporeans communicate,
share their experiences, and document their lives in the 21st century.
Collectively, social media content therefore represents a vital resource,
helping future researchers understand what Singapore and the world at large
was like during this period. It is also part of our national heritage,
and something we can look back on fondly, and pass on to future generations
as part of our memory.</p>
<p>Yet we cannot take for granted that social media content will always remain
available for access. Information on the internet disappears for all kinds
of reasons. Social media platforms may shut down or downsize, their terms
of access may change, and underlying technologies may evolve in a way that
changes how content looks or functions, or even renders them inaccessible.
In fact, in the long term, it is almost certain that all these things will
eventually happen.</p>
<p>To safeguard against this, the National Library collects and preserves
social media, ensuring Singapore’s digital memories and stories remain
accessible to future researchers and Singaporeans regardless of changes
to platforms or technology.</p>
<h2>Contribute social media content for future generations</h2>

<h2>Guide on exporting your social media content</h2>
