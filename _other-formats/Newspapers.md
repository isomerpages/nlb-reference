<h1><strong>Newspapers</strong></h1>
<p>The National Library holds an extensive collection of local and regional
newspapers, both archival and contemporary, to support research and learning
needs. Dating from the 19th century to the present day, our archival newspaper
collection can be accessed physically via Lee Kong Chian Reference Library’s
microfilm collection, or digitally via NewspaperSG and Factiva database.
Contemporary news is also available through SPH eNewspapers and PressReader
databases.</p>

from home on our NewspaperSG platform. Patrons can access post-1989 newspaper
