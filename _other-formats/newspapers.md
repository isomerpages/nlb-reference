<h1><strong>Newspapers</strong></h1>
<p>The National Library holds an extensive collection of local and regional
newspapers, both archival and contemporary, to support research and learning
needs. Dating from the 19th century to the present day, our archival newspaper
collection can be accessed physically via Lee Kong Chian Reference Library’s
microfilm collection, or digitally via NewspaperSG and Factiva database.
Contemporary news is also available through SPH eNewspapers, Factiva and
Press Reader databases.</p>
<h4>Newspaper Coverage</h4>
<p>With a few exceptions, newspapers published before 1989 can be accessed
from home on our NewspaperSG platform. Patrons can access post-1989 newspaper
publications through our on-site Library Multimedia Stations and microfilm
collection. For newspapers published within the last 7 to 30 days, users
can access Factiva or SPH Newspapers from home.</p>
<p>A summary of all our available platforms and access restrictions can be
found in the table below. Please refer to the respective links for a detailed
