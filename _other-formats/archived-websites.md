<h1><strong>Archived Websites</strong></h1>
<p>The National Library has a collection of Singapore websites of individuals,
associations, businesses, cultural organisations, significant events and
news. These websites are a valuable resource for researchers to study websites
which may no longer exist or observe changes in specific websites over
time. Together, these websites reflect various aspects of Singaporean life,
culture, and heritage in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The library’s archived websites collection dates from 2006 and contains
over 90,000 unique archived websites and webpages and more than 360,000
archived versions (snapshots of the same website over time). The collection
includes all publicly available .sg websites which the library has a mandate
to collect under the National Library Board Act since 2019, and a selection
of non .sg websites that are owned by Singaporeans or Singapore organisations/institutions
via permission seeking. The collection is accessible though the <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/webarchives/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Web Archive Singapore</a> (WAS)
portal.</p>
<p>Due to copyright laws, the archived websites can only be accessed from
a designated computer terminal on Level 11 of the <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/visit-us/our-libraries-and-locations/libraries/national-library-singapore/lee-kong-chian-reference-library" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lee Kong Chian Reference Library</a>,
unless permission has been granted by website owners to provide online
access. Archived websites that are currently available online includes
government websites and websites with the permission from copyright owners.</p>

<p>WAS employs full-text search capabilities and will display search results
that contain the keywords in the archived website’s title, content, documents,
or images.</p>
<h3><strong>Recommended steps to search for an archived website</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you know the <strong>website URL</strong> that you are searching for,
input the URL in the search bar, e.g. nlb.gov.sg. This search method will
likely return the most accurate results.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use keywords. To search for a phrase, use
quotation marks to generate better results, e.g. “National Library Board”.</p>
<p>TIP: Use Boolean operators to expand or narrow your search. For example,
'National Day Parade OR NDP' will retrieve websites containing the words
National Day Parade <strong>or</strong> NDP.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refine your search results by using the <strong>Accessibility, Type, Year, and URL filters</strong>.

<p>This is what the NLB website looked like on 28 Apr 2006. To view other
archived versions of the NLB website, you can either select the dates shown
in the timeline bar or ‘View Other Versions’ for the complete list of dates.</p>
<p>You can explore the archived website by clicking on the available links
within the website.</p>
<p>Depending on the record that you are viewing, the links within the website
may not load or you may see an error message. This may be due to several
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The link is pointing to another website (different URL) and was not archived
as it was outside our archiving scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is a large website, our crawler may have archived only a portion
of the website and not its entirety due to time and data size constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one page of the website has been selected for archiving, as only
that webpage met our selection criteria for preservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the display of the archived website will also lead to an error
message if you click on certain links (e.g. dropdown menus). When you encounter
such errors, we suggest that you explore the archived website via its sitemap
if it is available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
