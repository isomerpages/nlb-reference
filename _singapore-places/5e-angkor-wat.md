### <u>Introduction</u>

Angkor Wat, with its sheer size and complex architecture, is one of the most well-known monuments in Cambodia. Located north of Siem Reap and south of Angkor Thom, the construction began within the first half of the 12th century during the reign of King Suryavarman II. This was the zenith of cultural, religious and artistic development of the Khmer civilisation. The construction took an estimated 30 years to complete. Like most temples built during the Khmer empire, Angkor Wat began as a Hindu temple.

Some of the key features that have been widely studied by scholars include the West-facing orientation of Angkor Wat, historical and mythical narratives in the bas-reliefs and the engineering complexity of the massive monument. Some studies have speculated that the West-facing direction of Angkor Wat suggests a funerary monument for its founder, but other scholars have proposed that that it was a dedication the Hindu god, Vishnu, who is sometimes associated with the west. The western part of the south gallery depicts the army of Suryavarman II, including troops from Siam. The king is presented much larger than other personages in this historical narrative on the bas-relief. Hundreds of apsaras (divine nymphs) carvings depicting a variety of attitudes and dress offer insight to the Khmer civilization as well. Angkor Wat is a prime example of the temple-mountain concept. It was constructed in the image of Mount Meru, the sacred mountain in Hindu mythology. The central tower, rising 65 metres above the ground, symbolizes the central peak of Mount Meru and the four supporting towers represent the four surrounding peaks.

With a north-south axis that runs 1,300 metres and 1,500 metres on the east-west axis, it stands as one of the largest religious foundations in the world. In 1992, Angkor Wat was designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO.
