### <u>City of Gardens</u>

**Singapore: City of Gardens**

The whole push to make Singapore green is the result of a deliberate campaign, which began in the 1960s to transform Singapore into a “Garden City”. The aim was to create a pleasant living environment – a First Class oasis, and attract foreign investors, who could see how well the landscape (and the nation) was taken care of.

 

Today, Singapore has not only established the title of “Garden City” but is well-reputed as a model green city unequalled by major Asian cities. Residents and visitors can explore different natural habitats amidst the lush greenery in the city. They can trek the coastal hill forests of nature reserves, watch migratory birds at the mangroves at wetland reserve or visit more than a dozen parks and gardens located throughout the island. The Singapore Botanic Gardens is just 5 minutes from Orchard Road. City dwellers are never far away from greenery with skyrise and vertical gardening which are gaining widespread popularity.
