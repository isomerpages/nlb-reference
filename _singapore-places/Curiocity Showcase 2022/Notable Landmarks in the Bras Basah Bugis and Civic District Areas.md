# Notable Landmarks in the Bras Basah Bugis and Civic District Areas

## Curiocity: Places &amp; Perspectives

Looking at Singapore today, it is easy to forget that it was once dotted with *kampungs* and plantations. And as we have changed, so has our cityscape. By spotlighting selected leisure and entertainment places in downtown Singapore as well as presenting fascinating histories hidden in plain sight, Curiocity gives us an opportunity to examine the evolution of our spaces and reflect on our relationship with them.

Accessible both in-person and online, Curiocity invites you to discover, learn and engage with our island’s history through the content and collections from the National Library Board and its partners. Presented in partnership with the Light to Night Festival 2022, *Curiocity: Places &amp; Perspectives* is held at the National Library Building (3 January – 3 February 2022) and across several locations in the Civic District (14 January – 3 February 2022). Find out more about the showcase at .

This resource guide has been produced to complement the satellite installation ‘A Tessellation of Memories’ at The Arts House, exploring the thematic focus of **‘Notable landmarks in Bras Basah.Bugis and the Civic District’**.

### Introduction
Bras Basah.Bugis and the Civic District are home to some of Singapore’s most recognisable landmarks such as Raffles Hotel, St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall. Built during the colonial era, these historically and culturally significant buildings are integral to our cityscape. Some of these buildings have been repurposed and given new life. For instance, City Hall and the former Supreme Court were restored and transformed into National Gallery Singapore, a museum of modern Singapore and Southeast Asian art. 

Yet, there are many buildings that are no longer part of our built environment because of redevelopment. This guide highlights some of these notable landmarks in Bras Basah.Bugis and the Civic District. 

The Grand Hotel de l’Europe was once one of the finest hotels in Singapore and used to occupy the site of the former Supreme Court building at the turn of the 20th century. The Empress Hotel, one of the leading hotels in the 1950s and a popular wedding and anniversary dinner venue, previously stood where the National Library building now stands. The National Library moved from Stamford Road to Victoria Street in 2005. 

Bras Basah.Bugis and the Civic District, particularly North Bridge Road and High Street, were also popular with shoppers in the 1960s. The Metro store, a two-storey shophouse on High Street, was the go-to destination for those looking for the latest in fashion. The Treasury is now located there. The area was also known for food. For example, the row of hawker stalls along Waterloo Street was well-known for Indian food especially Indian *rojak*, and the Satay Club at the Esplanade, a waterfront food centre, was popular with locals and tourists during the 1970s and 80s.
