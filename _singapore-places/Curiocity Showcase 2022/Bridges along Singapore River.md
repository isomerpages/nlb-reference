# Bridges along Singapore River
## Curiocity: Places &amp; Perspectives

Looking at Singapore today, it is easy to forget that it was once dotted with *kampungs* and plantations. And as we have changed, so has our cityscape. By spotlighting selected leisure and entertainment places in downtown Singapore as well as presenting fascinating histories hidden in plain sight, Curiocity gives us an opportunity to examine the evolution of our spaces and reflect on our relationship with them.

Accessible both in-person and online, Curiocity invites you to discover, learn and engage with our island’s history through the content and collections from the National Library Board and its partners. Presented in partnership with the Light to Night Festival 2022, *Curiocity: Places &amp; Perspectives* is held at the National Library Building (3 January – 3 February 2022) and across several locations in the Civic District (14 January – 3 February 2022). Find out more about the showcase at . 

This resource guide has been produced to complement the main showcase ‘The River Connects’ at the Asian Civilisations Museum, exploring the thematic focus of **‘Bridges along Singapore River’**.

### Introduction
The Singapore River has a long, eventful history, and some have described it as our island’s lifeline for almost 200 years.[^1] The river’s calm waters made it an ideal harbour, enabling the waterway to serve as a key connector between Singapore and the rest of the world, bringing trade, people, and ideas to and from our historic port city.  

[^1]: Vernon Cornelius-Takahama &amp; Damien Wang, “[Singapore River (historical overview)](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=011fc400-0632-453b-8520-12ada317e263),” Singapore Infopedia, published 2016.

Not to be overlooked, however, are the many bridges erected across the Singapore River. From wooden bridges to modern structural bridges, these constructions have served as passageways where coolies, merchants, government administrators, and many others have interacted and formed connections with each other. The bridges not only tell stories of engineering failures and triumphs, but also stories of those who relied on the river for work, passage, leisure and even shelter.
