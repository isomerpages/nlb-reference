## <u>Introduction</u>

This resource guide lists some resources on the Indian National Army (INA) and prominent INA leader, Subhas Chandra Bose, which are available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. The Indian National Army (INA) was formed in Singapore in February 1942. At the urging of their Japanese captors, almost 20,000 Indian prisoners-of-war had come together to form this army with the aim of freeing India from British colonial rule. Under the charismatic leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose, who led the INA from July 1943 until his sudden death in August 1945, the INA grew in strength and received significant support from the civilian Indian population in Malaya. After World War II, the British charged some of the captured INA soldiers with treason. This resource guide lists some resources on the INA and Subhas Chandra Bose that are available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and on the internet.
