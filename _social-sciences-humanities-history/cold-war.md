## <u>Introduction</u>

The Cold War refers to the post World War II hostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States that eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Throughout the 45-year period, although no real battles were fought between the two superpowers, there was a threat of nuclear war on both sides, participation by proxy in the wars of their allied countries, a race for supremacy in space exploration, intense missile and nuclear weapon rivalry and economic competition in the form of American capitalism vs. Soviet communism.

This resource guide is not meant to be a comprehensive resource on the Cold War. Rather, it aims to provide an overview of the events leading up to the Cold War, the impact it created within and outside of Europe and how it was eventually resolved.

### <u>Origins of the Cold War</u>

Events leading up to the Cold War began when the alliance between the Soviet Union and its World War II allies, United States, France and Britain broke down in the years immediately after the war. Besides the clash in the diametrically opposing communist and democratic forms of government, Russia’s expansionist ambition to conquer the whole of Europe, beginning with setting up communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia) raised alarms among the Western democratic countries, who perceived Stalin and his ideology as threats to democracy. America and Russia also disagreed over the issue of nuclear weapons disarmament.

The Truman Doctrine, released on March 12, 1947, approving US$400 million to be given to Greece and Turkey to aid their fight against communism, signaled a formal declaration of Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. For the next three decades, America adopted a policy of containment against the Soviet Union, using political, economic and military strategies to stop the spread of communism in Europe and in Southeast Asia. The Soviet Union and its allied communist governments in Europe refused to participate in America’s Marshall Plan (1947), which aimed to provide financial aid to Europe to help them re-build their economies that had been devastated by World War Two.

The Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was another attempt by the Soviet Union to gain control over another European country, Germany, which had been divided into four sectors after World War Two: the French sector, British Sector, American sector and the Soviet sector. This blockade however failed due to the Western allies’ Berlin Airlift operation, which succeeded in providing supplies to people in West Berlin after the Soviet Union had blocked railway and road access to areas under Allied control.

The formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, with the United States pledging her commitment to protect Europe in the event of any attacks, further increased the antagonistic tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both countries intensified the rebuilding of their military forces, which soon escalated to a nuclear arms rivalry, with both countries racing to be the first to develop the most deadly of all bombs – the hydrogen bomb. In response to the Western alliance’s NATO, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance or Warsaw Pact in 1955, a defence strategy joined by eight communist states in Eastern Europe. These two opposing blocs and the continuing rivalry between both countries thus gave shape to the developments of the Cold War.

### <u>End of the Cold War</u>

Over the course of five decades, the Cold War underwent periods of fluctuating tension and confrontation, entering a period of cooperation during the 1960s and a period of détente during the 1970s (mid-point of the Cold War) which saw a general easing of strained relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

During the 70’s, leaders of the two superpowers held a series of summits and several treaties were successfully reached through them, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties (SALT I and SALT II), the installation of a direct hotline between Washington DC and Moscow that enabled both countries to communicate with each other in urgent situations and the Helsinki Declaration (also known as Helsinki Accords) signed by 35 nations to improve relations between Communist-led countries and the Western democratic countries.

The period of détente lasted barely a decade as several events led to its dissolution, such as the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 and the election of Ronald Reagan (who ran on an anti-détente campaign) as the new US President in 1980.

1979 to the mid-1980s marked a return to Cold War hostilities (second Cold War) with increased military tensions, due to the introduction of the Reagan doctrine, which included providing support to countries such as Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, who were trying to overthrow their Communist governments. The US also installed cruise missiles in Europe and introduced the Strategic Defence Initiative (also known as ‘Star Wars’) to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.

The early 1980s also saw an unprecedented splurge of military spending by both the Soviet Union (up to as much as 25 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP)) and the United States (up to 6.5 percent of its GNP) to shore up their military arsenal and armed forces in the midst of increasing Cold War tensions.

The oil glut in the 1980s and unsustainable military expenditures soon led to a stagnation in the Soviet Union’s economy. This was exacerbated by the increasing costs of its involvement in the on-going Afghanistan war.

1985-1991 marked the final years of the Cold War. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the Soviet Union in 1985, he came up with several measures to help revive the flagging economy and direct the country’s resources away from the arms race to develop its domestic industries. One economic policy was perestroika (restructuring), introduced in June 1987, which facilitated private ownership of businesses and welcomed the influx of foreign investment and the other was glasnost (openness) that called for press freedom and transparency of government operations.

Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union began to mend with a series of summits held from 1985 to 1989, resulting in the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan and the reunification of Germany in 1990.

The Cold War was officially declared over by both superpower leaders, Gorbachev and George W. Bush, at the 1989 Malta Summit.

Shortly after in 1990, the Communist Party, which had retained its stronghold over the USSR for 73 years, surrendered in the face of dwindling Soviet military support. Communist-led countries in Central and Eastern Europe broke away from the USSR and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. The Soviet empire was finally dissolved on December 25, 1991.

The resources here examine the developments that lead to the resolution of the Cold War.
