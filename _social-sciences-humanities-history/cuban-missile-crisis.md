### <u>Introduction</u>

The Cuban Missile Crisis (14 Oct – 20 Nov 1962) nearly led to a nuclear war outbreak between the Soviet Union and the United States, with Cuba unfortunately sandwiched in the conflict.

In 1962, the Soviet Union secretly installed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba to counter the United States’ lead in developing missile weapon technology and also as a form of protection for Cuba as deterrence against any US-led invasions.

Despite repeated and vehement denials from Soviet Union diplomats regarding the missile installations in Cuba, President John Kennedy had irrefutable proof from photographs of their existence and he made a televised broadcast on 22 October 1962, announcing to the world that any missile attack from Cuba would constitute an attack from the Soviet Union and hence the US would respond accordingly. He also imposed a ban on any shipments of military weapons from the Soviet Union.

Many communication exchanges took place between Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and President Kennedy before an agreement was reached on 28 Oct 1962. Under the terms of this agreement, the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle and withdraw all missile installations in Cuba and remove all Soviet light bombers, while the US gave their assurance that they would not invade Cuba.

This section provides reference sources that discuss how the Cuban Missile Crisis began, the motivations behind the parties involved and how it was eventually resolved without bloodshed or lives lost.
