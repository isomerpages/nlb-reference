## **Introduction**

“Fast fashion,” a term used to describe inexpensive and widely-available “in the moment” garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing. By making available large quantities of clothing at throwaway prices, fast fashion has emerged as a dominant business model, causing garment consumption to soar. While this trend may be considered as the “democratisation” of fashion in which the latest styles are available to all classes of consumers, the human and environmental health risks associated with fast fashion are said to be hidden throughout the life-cycle of each piece of clothing. 

Fast fashion’s speedy supply chains rely on outsourced and often underpaid labour from factory workers overseas, and the process is environmentally damaging and resource-intensive. Critics claim that the “blindingly fast pace at which fast fashion clothes are manufactured, worn and discarded means that they have become more disposable, more commodities than keepsakes, and shoppers are essentially conditioned to expect a constant stream of new items.” 

This resource guide shines the spotlight on the phenomenon of fast fashion, why it is so popular, its environmental impacts, and alternative fashion trends that counter it.

##### **Ultra fast-fashion is eating the world**

Even during the COVID-19 pandemic with the world economy taking a massive hit, demand for “cheap, cute clothes” is said to have persisted. While the rest of the retail sector struggled, a new cohort of companies such as Boohoo and Asos, known as ultra-fast fashion, thrived. Asos’ sales rose rapidly from March to June 2020 and Boohoo was reported to have had its “best quarter ever.” These companies leveraged digital platforms to fulfill their customers’ demand for fast fashion.

##### **Why professional women are breaking up with fast fashion**

With the killing of over 1,000 factory workers in the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh in 2013, professional women have started wondering about the true cost of making fast fashion clothes. Many fast fashion brands outsource their production overseas where garments are produced with unfair pay and poor work conditions. Professional women who support sustainability are reported to have now turned to circular fashion, a system in which articles are circulated and reused for as long as they can be, before being decomposed safely.

##### **Fast fashion is on the rampage, with the UK at the head of the charge**

Fashion consumers in the United Kingdom are reported to be among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the largest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfills in 2018.

##### **The true cost of fast fashion**

Fast fashion allows consumers to buy more clothes, but they are wearing them less often and disposing of them at an unprecedented rate. Millions of tonnes of clothes are reported to be ending up in landfills every year. This video takes a look at how the fashion industry can continue to grow while addressing the environmental need for people to buy fewer clothes.

Several swapping initiatives from permanent shops to pop-up events have appeared in Singapore in a bid to encourage consumers to be environmentally conscious. However, challenges remain in persuading Singaporeans to swap rather than shop.

The speaker in this video laments that “fast fashion is fooling us to believe we are saving money when in reality all we are doing is buying more of a lower quality product.” More importantly, “fast fashion is destroying people in the planet depending on where the products are made, how they are made, and where they ultimately end up.”

##### **Are low- and middle-income countries profiting from fast fashion?**

Low- and middle-income countries have made substantial economic progress in the past two decades due to the fast fashion industry. This, however, has come at a high social and environmental cost. This article suggests that now is the right time to find a balance between economic development and harm caused to the citizens of these nations.

##### **Consumer adoption of fast-fashion, differences of perceptions, and the role of motivations across the adoption groups**

Adopters of fast fashion are classified as “innovators”, “early adopters”, “early majority”, “late majority”, and “laggards”. This research finds that perceptions of fast-fashion vary across different consumer adoption groups in terms of “being in-style products”, “expressing self-image”, “imitating luxury fashion products”, and “frequent renewal of collections”.

##### **See it. Like it. Buy it. Repeat. Fast fashion gets faster.** 

This article highlights that “while trends used to be set twice a year in the pages of Vogue and on Paris runways, now they sprout up daily from the Instagram feeds of fashion models and celebrities.” Retailers are said to have recognised that “fashion’s centre of gravity has shifted, and have found a way to capitalise on it.”

##### **Is slow fashion the new luxury? If fast fashion defined the 2010s, slow fashion may be the marker of the new decade**

For years, the fashion industry is said to have pushed mass production and consumption so rapidly that, “quick-turn, quick-churn fashion is now falling out of favour and making way for its more measured counterpart.” The COVID-19 pandemic is seen to have helped foster a “buy less, buy better mentality with interest sparking in products with more value and longevity compared to disposable fast fashion.”

##### **The global environmental injustice of fast fashion**	

This paper posits that while fast fashion offers consumers an opportunity to buy more clothes for less, those who work in or live near textile manufacturing facilities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health hazards. Furthermore, increased consumption patterns are also said to have created millions of tonnes of textile waste in landfills and unregulated settings.

##### **A multi-dimensional view of consumer value to explain socially-responsible consumer behavior: A fuzzy-set analysis of Generation Y’s fast-fashion consumers**

Generation Y consumers are believed to be aware of the different environmental problems affecting society. However, their attitudes or intentions may not actually translate into action, particularly in the fashion domain. This study examines the consumption values that explain the presence or absence of socially-responsible behaviour among Gen Y fast fashion consumers.

This book traces the life-cycle of a pair of jeans. Raw materials from a Texas cotton farm are sent for dyeing and weaving to factories in China, and then sewn in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, before being transported back to the United States. The jeans’ journey usually ends in a landfill in Africa. The book sheds light on the hazards posed by fast fashion and how the "trend-based aesthetic of celebrity/influencer culture" has contributed to the rise of disposable fashion.

This book explores the rise of America’s “addiction to cheap fashion, the true nature of cheap fashion, the rise of budget clothing chains, and the death of middle-market and independent retailers.” The author also explores how cheap fashion harms the charity thrift shops and textile recyclers where most of the disposed clothing ends up.
