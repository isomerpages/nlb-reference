<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p>Linguistics is the scientific study of language, which can be broadly
divided into numerous areas of study, including morphology (word structure),
syntax (phrase and sentence structure), phonetics/phonology (sound system),
and semantics/pragmatics (meaning).</p>
<p>The various fields of linguistics cover a wide range of research and application,
including language documentation, language acquisition and education, sociolinguistics,
neurolinguistics, corpus linguistics, translation, and interpretation.</p>
<p>This guide highlights resources on linguistics that are available at the
Lee Kong Chian Reference Library as well as on the Internet. As the guide
is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the
NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources.</p>

<h3><u>Books</u></h3>
<p>Books and texts are often mainstays of resource guides as these provide
introductory and comprehensive information on a particular topic. The books
below range from broad overviews of the field of linguistics to more specific
discussions of language acquisition, historical linguistics, corpus linguistics,
and more. There are books dealing with global linguistic issues as well
as more localised publications, including some focused on Singapore and
Southeast Asia. Together they constitute a substantial variety of in-depth
material on linguistics and its different fields.</p>
