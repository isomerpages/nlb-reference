The COVID-19 pandemic is more than just a health crisis. It encompasses human, economic and social crises that have indiscriminately disrupted and affected people’s lives and livelihoods.[^1] However, communities around the world are demonstrating solidarity, strength and resilience by banding together to provide support and help to those who are vulnerable and in need.

Community resilience, which refers to the community’s ability to utilise available resources to respond, withstand, adapt and recover from adversity, is exhibited through the many community-led and ground-up initiatives that have been established in Singapore and other countries in recent months.[^2] People from varied backgrounds around the world are volunteering their time, knowledge, skills and resources to help not just the elderly and disabled but also healthcare workers, foreign workers and families in need. There are groups rallying to help those facing discrimination or stigma as a result of misinformation surrounding the virus.[^3] Fundraising campaigns have also been launched to provide financial relief to those affected by COVID-19.[^4]

In Singapore, the SGUnited portal was launched on 20 February 2020. The one-stop portal enables those keen to contribute to community-led efforts to help those affected by the disruptions caused by the pandemic through donations, volunteering or other
forms of support.[^5] Some of the initiatives included providing meals for the breaking of fast during the month of Ramadan, sewing reusable masks for migrant workers, supporting local businesses through the purchase of gift cards and monetary donations to support the urgent and critical needs of vulnerable local communities.[^6]
