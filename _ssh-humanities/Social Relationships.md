Human beings are inherently social creatures. Our emotional and physical wellbeing are affected by the strength of our varied relationships at home, work, school and play. Social connections affect our sense of self-esteem and mental wellbeing. Research has shown that strong, healthy relationships strengthen our immune systems, help us recover from diseases, and may even lengthen our lives.[^1]

In order to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19, people have had to practice social distancing, modify how they communicate, interact remotely and adjust their ways of life.[^2] A simple restaurant meal with friends or attending concerts and sporting events are now off the cards as the world adapts to a new normal.

In Singapore, family members living in separate households and friends have not been able to physically meet since the implementation of the Circuit Breaker period on 7 April 2020. Even as Circuit Breaker measures progressively ease from 2 June, non-essential activities and social gatherings remain prohibited.[^3] While people are getting used to connecting with loved ones via social media, phone calls and video conferencing, there has also been a downside to social isolation measures. Being in close proximity for a prolonged period at home has not only given rise to tensions and strained relationships but an increase in domestic abuse cases.[^4]
