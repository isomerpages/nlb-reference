### <u>Introduction</u>

Globalisation, technological change and innovation, changes in work organisations, environmental change and demographic changes are affecting many traditional jobs and employment relations as well as creating new job opportunities in emerging industries and economies. Skills requirements are changing rapidly due to these structural shifts.

A large number of educated American workers see a greater need for ongoing training and skills development. Soft skills are seen as more important than technical skills. Skills that are perceived as important are interpersonal skills; followed by critical thinking; good written and spoken communication; management and leadership; basic computer skills; ability to do physical or manual work; high-level math, analytical, computer skills; and the ability to operate or build machinery and equipment. The European Union sees a need for employees to have a balanced mix of skills; broader skill profiles; and acquire new specialised and technical skills throughout working life.

Hence, it is essential for education and training systems to respond more promptly to emerging skills needs. Countries are developing new skills policies to address the existing skills mismatch. The United Kingdom’s apprenticeship policy aims to train three million new apprentices by 2020. The European Union’s new skills agenda for Europe stresses on the role of transversal skills (learning skills, career management skills and STEM skills), skills guarantee for low-skilled adults, and the importance of introducing more VET qualifications. Australia’s vocational education and training (VET) has a strong focus on work-based learning and an increasingly emerging emphasis on work-integrated learning in universities.

This resource guide presents relevant reports and studies on the current and future skills and training needs, and drivers of change in Singapore, the European Union and the United States; measures taken by countries to address skills demand such as the United Kingdom’s apprenticeships policy, and work-based learning and work-integrated learning in Australia; and the recommendations to G20 leaders to meet their skill needs.

 

### <u>The future of talent in Singapore 2030</u>

This report explores the future skills and talent needs, and the management and development practices in Singapore up to 2030. It examines the current approaches to human capital management and tests it against possible future scenarios to uncover biases and potential blind spots in decision-making. It details what is “talent”; the drivers shaping the context of talent; four possible scenarios Singapore might encounter in 2030 such as “steady as she goes”, “no one is an island”, “fortress Singapore”, and “bless thy neighbour”; and the implications of these scenarios.

### <u>European sectoral trends: The next decade</u>

Demographic changes, better access to education, technological advances and climate change are impacting the European Union workforce by encouraging employment growth in services, increasing the need for high qualifications, creating high replacement demands, and leading to changes in job content and tasks. To meet these demands, education and training in the EU needs to have: a balanced mix of skills across sectors, countries and qualification levels; broader skill profiles across occupations and qualifications, combining technical and behavioural skills; and acquire new rapidly changing specialised and technical skills.

### <u>Skills development and employment: New skills agenda for Europe</u>

This new skills agenda to keep the European economy competitive consists of ten key actions that aim to reduce existing skills gaps and skills mismatches. The four ways the agenda will tackle the challenges include: addressing the gaps in basic skills thorough Skills Guarantee; promoting the attractiveness of vocational education and training; revising the European Qualifications Framework; and revising the Europass Framework. It also discusses skills guarantee for low-skilled adults; modernisation of vocational education and training; revision of the European Qualifications Framework; and revision of the Europass Framework.

### <u>Enhancing employability</u>

This report proposes actionable principles to meet the skill needs of G20 economies:

1. Anticipating skill needs and adapting policies accordingly

a. Collect and use robust information to assess existing and future skills needs and address imbalances. For example, Canada carries out multiple skills assessment and anticipation exercises; and Brazil involves the private sector to develop skills forecast and provide training.

b. Promote co-ordination and dialogue between various stakeholders to ensure better collection, dissemination and use of skill needs information. For example, France used skills assessment to develop its green economy policy; and Turkey used it to promote industry apprenticeship in demand specific skills.

c. Strengthen the incentives and enforcement of training systems to be responsive to demands when they cannot be fulfilled by employers.

2. Reinforcing the role of training and work-based learning

a. Expand participation in work-based learning for successful transitions from school to work and to improve quality of skills development.

b. Promote job retention and re-employment through retraining and active labour market programmes.

c. Enhance flexibility and governance within the TVET system at the local level to ensure that institutions and programmes adapt to the needs of employers, individuals and the local labour market. For example, Australia uses market-based mechanisms to steer TVET provision.

d. Address barriers to participation and provide incentives for individuals from disadvantaged groups – low-skilled, youth, migrants – to participate in lifelong learning and employability programmes. For example, in March 2014, China launched a vocational skills upgrading scheme for rural migrant workers.

e. Maintain a balance between responding to specific employer needs and developing more general transferable skills that will benefit the individual.

3. Enhancing the adaptability of workplaces

a. Promote innovation and introduce high-performance work practices. In 2003, Australia introduced skills ecosystems which covered VET links with research agencies to promote innovation, promote new technologies, workplace drivers of skill formation, job design and career paths. The Singapore Workforce Development Agency manages the Work-Pro scheme to help employers adopt progressive workplace management practices.

b. Facilitate local and national partnerships and bring together social partners and training organisations and other intermediaries to design strategies to improve workplace adaptability.

4. Promoting labour mobility

a. Address institutional barriers such as rules and regulations to job and location changes.

b. Facilitate labour mobility through better skills assessment, skills recognition and re-training strategies.

### <u>The state of American jobs</u>

The majority of American workers believe that new skills and training may hold the key to their future job success. Many see personal upgrading as a constant and are undergoing extra training to improve their job skills. The public sees job threats coming from various factors such as the outsourcing of jobs to other countries, contract or temporary workers, and the changing nature of jobs that require higher social or analytical skills. A mix of soft skills and technical skills are seen as crucial to succeed in the present job market.

### <u>Apprenticeships policy in England</u>

This paper looks at the current apprenticeship system in England including, minimum wage and employee rights; funding of apprenticeships; minimum standards; and support available for employers. It details the apprenticeship policy developments since 2015, covering the three million apprenticeship commitment; apprenticeship levy; the funding reform; the new funding system and funding bands; apprentice training providers; and the higher minimum wage for apprentices.

### <u>Work-based learning and work-integrated learning: Fostering engagement with employers</u>

Work-based learning “occurs in a work environment, through participation in work practices and process, and is integral to vocational education and training.” Work-integrated learning at university comprises a range of programmes and activities in which theoretical learning is integrated intentionally with the practice of work through specifically designed curriculum, pedagogic practices and student engagement. These two concepts need the involvement of employers and the industry. This research identifies how engagement with industry and employers can be fostered, and what the two sectors can learn from each other.
