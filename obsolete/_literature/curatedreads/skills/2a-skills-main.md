## **Skills**

_"The problem is not that there are not enough jobs; \[the\] problem is to match the jobs, workers, skills and expectations with what jobs are available, with what skills are in demand and make sure they can do the job."_

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong

When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made this statement in his May Day Rally on 1 May 2016, he gave us a clear assessment on how the job market has changed as we progress further into the 21st century. With the advent of factors such as rising costs, changing demand and disruptive technology, the good old days of clear career paths and stable employment are being replaced by a more dynamic labour market that requires workers to constantly reinvent themselves and pick up new skills.
 

In view of these developments, we have identified some reading materials to help you make that first step to reinvent yourself in the workplace. These resources are based on 10 skills that are critical to the workforce of the 21st century. Let us read and learn together to create the workforce of tomorrow.
