One of the most crucial skills in the workplace, critical thinking involves analysing a situation from all angles in order to generate optimal solutions. However, many employees and even those in leadership positions do not exercise this skill as much as they should. The lack of critical thinking results in hasty decisions, careless mistakes and sometimes even costly measures to remedy the problem. To help you acquire this important skill, we have prepared the following resources as a starting point.

## **CORE READ**

| ![Art of thinking image](/images/literature/curatedreads/skills/Art-of-thinking-350X552.jpg) | **The Art of Thinking Clearly** <br><br> Call no.: 153.42 DOB <br><br> An interesting, easy-to-read book on how one can “learn to recognise and evade the biggest errors in thinking” (p. xviii), this multidisciplinary work draws from theories in behavioural economics, psychology and neuroscience. |

Using real-life examples, each chapter unpacks the cognitive biases that affect the decisions we make every day. In Chapter 20, for example, Rolf Dobelli examines the tendency to judge a decision by its outcome and argues that it is more important to understand the reasons for making that decision in the first place:

_"A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair out about a wrong decision, or applauding yourself for one that may have only co-incidentally led to success, remember why you chose what you did. Were your reasons rational and understandable? Then you would do well to stick with that method, even if you didn't strike it lucky last time."_
