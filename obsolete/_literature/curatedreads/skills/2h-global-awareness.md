The world is a small place. Events that occur on the other side of the globe can affect us more than we think. However, global awareness is not just about recognising the impact of world issues on local society, but also being mindful of and respectful towards differences when interacting with others. This is especially crucial in a global city like Singapore, which is characterised by its cultural diversity. Discover more from the resources below.

**Managing Diversity in the Workplace**

As Singapore globalises so does its workforce. Employees of different generations, nationalities and cultures often work together. With such workforce diversity, it becomes important for organisations to put in place policies and practices to build an inclusive and harmonious workplace. [Hereâ€™s a toolkit](https://www.mom.gov.sg/~/media/mom/documents/employment-practices/wdm/workplace%20diversity%20management%20tookit%20and%20managers%20guide.pdf) prepared by the Ministry of Manpower to help you get started.

**Singapore: Global City**

_"Singapore survives and will survive because it has established a relationship of interdependence in the rapidly expanding global economic system. Singapore's economic future will, as the years go by, become more and more rooted in this global system. It will grow and prosper as this system grows and prospers. It will collapse if this system collapses."_

**Cross-cultural Negotiations: Avoiding the Pitfalls**

Most of us understand that when entering into negotiations, we should always take into account cultural factors such as the educational or religious background of the person sitting across the table. But according to INSEAD professor Horacio Falcao [in this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4GjC0ipJIA), many tend to under- or overestimate these cross-cultural aspects.
