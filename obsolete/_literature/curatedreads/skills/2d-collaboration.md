When working on a project, it is likely that not all in the team know everything they need to perform the task. However, by collaborating with others from different departments, and even companies, skills can be pooled to make the project more successful. In addition, collaboration translates to a happier and more knowledgeable workplace. This is because the sense of community it inspires not only makes workers feel like they are part of a family, but also cultivates a culture where employees and employers learn from each other. Find out how to cultivate this important skill from the resources below.

“Collaboration essentials,” “Setting up for success”, “Fostering a collaborative culture in your organisation” are some of the interesting chapters worth reading. Our favourite chapter  is "Stages of Collaboration", where the author lists the various stages of collaboration and explains why planning is crucial for any collaborative effort to be successful:

_"The way in which a collaboration gets started can determine whether it succeeds or fails. Groups that pay careful attention to components at the early stages are more likely to be able to handle obstacles, stay focused on their goal, and come up with truly innovative ideas. (p. 89)"_

**Collaborative Intelligence: Four Influential Strategies for Thinking with People Who Think Differently**

Call no.: 658.4022 MAR

Collaborative intelligence, or CQ, is a measure of our ability to think with others on behalf of what matters to us all.

CQ is emerging as a new professional currency at a time when the way we think, interact and innovate is shifting. Drawing on more than 50 years of original research in cognitive neuroscience, this book teaches us how to recognise our own mind patterns and map the talents of our teams, with the goal of embarking on an aligned course of action and influence.

[Boost your CQ with this ebook](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/eReads/cms/details?uuid=6c0a8577-0c05-45b8-87b9-7cca6539fcc2) or visit our public libraries to borrow a physical copy.
