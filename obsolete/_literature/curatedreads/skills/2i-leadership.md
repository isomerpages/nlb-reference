Drawing on case studies and scientific research, Simon Sinek shows us how the best organisations build an environment where their people feel safe and confident to share ideas and collaborate with their peers.

_"There is a pattern that exists in the organisations that achieve the greatest success, the ones that outmanoeuvre and outinnovate their competitors, the ones that command the greatest respect from inside and outside their organisations, the ones with the highest loyalty and lowest churn and the ability to weather nearly every storm or challenge. These exceptional organisations all have cultures in which the leaders provide cover from above and the people on the ground look out for each other. This is the reason they are willing to push hard and take the kinds of risks they do. And the way any organisation can achieve this is with empathy."_

_"When leaders overwork themselves, their teams tend to do the same . . . Eventually, the team members get burned out in such an environment. The quality of their work declines. Their energy and morale plummet. They look for new jobs that will be less stressful. When they quit, they leave their leader shorthanded with an open role to fill. That vacancy increases the leader's stress and puts additional burden on other team members to pick up the slack. The negative performance spiral picks up speed with no sign of slowing down."_
