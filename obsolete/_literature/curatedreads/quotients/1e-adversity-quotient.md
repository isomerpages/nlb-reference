The word “adversity” describes a difficult or distressing situation and being resilient during such tough times calls for extra grit. The adversity quotient measures how one would respond to adversity and challenges in his or her life. While adversity can cause one to fall apart, it can also turn into a moment of learning, an opportunity for personal or professional growth as well as a season during which new strength is discovered. Read on and be inspired by how others have overcome their adversities.
