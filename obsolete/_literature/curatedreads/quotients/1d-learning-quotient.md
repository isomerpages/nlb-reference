It can take the form of formal learning in a classroom setting or informal learning from reading books or watching videos. The benefits of learning include raising your expertise in a particular skill, sharpening your mental cognitive ability, expanding your career options and opportunities as well as enabling you to pursue new hobbies and interests.

**Auto: Learning through self-teaching and experimentation**

In this [talk](https://youtu.be/bX_dAC8Iso8), Connor Edsall, a biologist/geneticist at the National Institutes of Health in the U.S., redefines the concepts of self-education and experimentation. He highlights three individuals with little to nearly zero formal education who have improved their lives and changed the world through self-education.
