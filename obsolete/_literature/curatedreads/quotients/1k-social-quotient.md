First coined by American psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1920, social intelligence (or quotient) refers to the ability to manage people and to know what to say and how to present oneself in different social situations. People who are socially intelligent are effective listeners, possess savvy conversational skills and understand the importance of valuing the opinions of others. Social intelligence is a skill that can be learnt and developed by observing social cues, practicing active listening and being respectful of cultural differences.
