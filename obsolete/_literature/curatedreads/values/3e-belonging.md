Nothing drives home that feeling of belonging and togetherness among citizens all over the world more than when they celebrate their nationhood. Singaporeans come together every 9th of August to celebrate National Day, when we reaffirm our sense of national belonging, transcending cultural and ethnic differences.

Understanding our nation's history and its development is crucial to forming our own sense of identity and rootedness. These resources will help you gain a better understanding of Singapore's rich heritage.

The sense of belonging together belonging to one entity, one unity, is a must in our task of nation building. An old nation with an ancient past has long historic experiences to bind its people together. We may not be able to afford such a long time to evolve a common heritage for our people."_
