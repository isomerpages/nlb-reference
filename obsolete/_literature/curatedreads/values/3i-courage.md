What does it mean to have courage? Is living fearlessly considered courageous? Why are some individuals more courageous than others?

Nelson Mandela once said, “I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."

According to Psychology Today, there are six attributes to courage: (1) feeling fear yet choosing to act; (2) following your heart; (3) persevering in the face of adversity; (4) standing up for what is right; (5) expanding your horizons by letting go of the familiar; and (6) facing suffering with dignity or faith.

 

Courage may not come easily for some of us. But if we try, we can. If we can, we will.
