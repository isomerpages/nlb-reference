## <u>Introduction</u>

1978 marks the launch of economic reforms for China when veteran statesman Deng Xiaoping assumed leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and introduced a new economic development strategy aimed at rebuilding China’s ailing economy and society.

The new Chinese government led by Deng Xiaoping adopted an open-door policy and encouraged foreign trade and investment to spur economic growth and to improve the living standards of its citizens. Deng’s era which was characterised by economic liberalism and entrepreneurial expansion helped to kick-start China’s economy. In the ensuing three decades since the opening of China’s economy, coupled with China’s entry in to the World Trade Organisation in 2001, China’s economy grew by quantum leaps. 

According to the Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US, China is now regarded as the world’s leading economy by respondents in 12 out of 38 countries surveyed, particularly for countries in Europe and others such as Jordan, Canada, UK and Australia. (Source: Wike, R., Poushter, J., Silver, L. & Bishop, C. (2017, July 13). Globally, more name U.S. than China as world’s leading economic power. Retrieved November 1, 2017, from Pew Research Center website: [http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/07/13/more-name-u-s-than-china-as-worlds-leading-economic-power/](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/07/13/more-name-u-s-than-china-as-worlds-leading-economic-power/).

Despite the total lifting of the one-child rule in November 2015, the number of births in China has only increased marginally. The author suggests that the Chinese government should introduce policies that will make it easier for citizens to have children and offer schemes to provide financial and healthcare support for its greying population.

China’s economy grew by 6.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. This was largely due to larger outputs from the manufacturing, coal mining and construction sectors. However, inefficiencies in these industries and rising corporate debt if left unsolved could cause sluggish economic growth and pull the plug on China’s aspirations to become a “moderately prosperous society by 2020”.

<b><u>Accessing the Print Materials</u></b>

You can search the library catalogue (for physical materials) in the library and from home (http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg). The easy search function allows you to search/browse by author, title, keyword, subject and ISBN/ISSN whereas the advanced search allows you to narrow your searches to specific media types or language holdings. In both instances, you will also be able to limit your search to specific libraries by clicking on the “limit by branch” option.

**To search Lee Kong Chian Reference Library’s Holdings**

If you wish to search for only materials available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, please always click on the “Limit by Branch” button at the bottom of the page, after you have keyed in your search term. This brings you to a new page whereby you will be able to select the library of your choice. Choose “Lee Kong Chian Reference Library” and select “yes” under the “Display only items available in the selected branch below” and then click on search.

**Things to note:**

Once you have identified the title that you need, please double-check the following information and write down the necessary info:

i. The “Status” of the item: the item is <u>not available</u> in the library, if the status displayed is “in transit”, “in process” or “not ready for loan”.

ii. Double-check that the item is in Lee Kong Chian Reference Library under “Branch”.

iii. Write down the <b><u>Location Code</u></b> and the <b><u>Call Number</u></b> of the item. This helps you to locate the item within Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. Please refer to the table below for more information (Note: Please feel free to approach the counter staff for help in locating the books.)

All featured books and periodicals are located at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.
