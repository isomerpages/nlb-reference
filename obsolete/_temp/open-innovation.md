### <u>Introduction</u>

Open innovation is the crowdsourcing of knowledge and resources from external sources to drive internal innovation. This concept was developed by Henry Chesbrough, a professor at the University of Berkeley’s Haas Business School, in 2003. Since then, many organisations such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Unilever, Samsung and JTC Corporation, have leveraged open innovation to discover new ideas as well as design better products and solutions.

This is a selection of resources on open innovation available from the [NLB catalogue](http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/) or the Internet. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
