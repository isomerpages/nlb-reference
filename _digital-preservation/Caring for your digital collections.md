<h4>1. <u>Why do we preserve?</u></h4>
<p>What will you do if, you are no longer able to view the photographs you
have taken with your very first digital camera? Imagine how disappointing
you will be if your university dissertation is “stuck” in an outdated word
processing format and you aren’t able to retrieve it? Examples of these
and many more of our personal documents not only chronicle meaningful milestones
in our lives, they can also hold important information.</p>
<p>Similarly, there may be serious consequences should the same happen in
your professional life. For example, if you are an author or creative professional
who, like so many people nowadays, had worked on their magnum opus on the
computer, it would be upsetting if you are unable to access the drafts
that had captured your creative process.</p>
<p>As technology advances, some of these things may become irretrievable.
To keep our memories for future generations, it is paramount that we actively
preserve our digital content.</p>
<p>This guide offers useful tips on how you can ensure that your digital
materials can be accessed in the future.</p>
<h4>2. <u>Identify what you want to preserve</u></h4>
<p>Think of and look through all the different places where your digital
materials could be stored. These could include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your laptops or desktop computers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your camera;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your handphone;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diskettes / floppy disks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud-based storage platforms (e.g. Google Drive, Google Photos).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gather all the materials and examine the items in them.</p>
<h4>3. <u>Decide which items matter most</u></h4>
<p>You can prioritise the items that are of the highest value to you or your
family. These could be rare items or hold a lot of sentimental value. If
you have more than one of the same items, prioritise saving the one that
has the highest quality.</p>
<h4>4. <u>Organise your digital content</u></h4>
<p>Sometimes, you may encounter a huge array of files and not know how to
find a photo from a certain occasion. Organising your digital content goes
a long way for effective preservation. Below are some useful tips for organising
your collection:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create a main folder for each collection, e.g. “My 16th Birthday” or “Wedding
Anniversary.” Then, you can also create sub-folders labelled with simple
titles like “documents,” “videos” and “photos”.[^1]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you can create folders with items that are organised chronologically
e.g. “April 2018” and “May 2018”.[^2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When labelling content, make the file name descriptive and include the
date. Avoid spaces or special characters besides the underscore (_), as
certain software may be unable to read files with such names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can indicate file versions with suffixes like “v1,” “v2” and “vfinal”.[^3]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would also be useful to record key information about your digital materials.
The following are details you can consider recording:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Number of items in each collection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Title;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creator/author/contributor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publisher/organiser;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of content (e.g. still image, audio, video, text etc.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short descriptions/captions/synopsis of content;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation date of content (in YYYY/MM/DD format);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation venue (if any);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Country;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of pages/sheets/duration of the audio-visual material;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photo/video/audio/publication credit or rights (if any) (in YYYY);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remarks/condition of items.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. <u>Create backups and/or transfer to new storage media</u></h4>
<p>You may only have one document that holds the initial sketches to your
final artwork, or your journal notes for your published book. To ensure
these materials remain accessible in the future, do save copies in different
locations, in addition to your main storage folder.</p>
<p>These backups can be stored in a storage media or system like a flash
drive, hard disk or cloud storage. If some of your materials are already
in cloud storage, you can migrate to another cloud storage platform should
the current one be in danger of obsolescence. An external hard drive is
recommended as it is portable and can hold large amounts of content. You
can also make a copy of your hard drive.[^4]</p>
<p>You should keep such storage media in an environment with constant temperature
and relative humidity to protect them from fluctuations in heat, humidity
and dust levels. However, there is still the risk of corruption, decay
and obsolescence. It will be helpful to check on your files and transfer
them to new storage media on a regular basis.[^5]</p>
<p>You can also print copies of important pictures or documents so that they
are still available in an alternative format.[^6]</p>

<h4>6. <u>Ensure sustainability</u></h4>
<p>Check your saved materials at least once each year to ensure they are
still accessible. However, you should not allow unauthorised access to
your files. Here are some tips to prevent unauthorised access:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check if your software or device has customisable settings that will let
you control who can access the files stored within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypt or protect your documents with a password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use storage formats that limit access and modification by others. For
example, ensure a document is “Read-Only” or save it as a PDF, which is
less easily modified than a word document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both hardware and software become obsolete over time. To avoid losing
access to your digital content and materials, actions such as proactively
checking for updates or decommissioning, and switching to a different storage
medium, must be taken in advance.[^7]</p>
<p>To protect your treasure trove of valuable information from malware and
virus threats, you are also encouraged to conduct regular scans and keep
your anti-virus software up to date.</p>
