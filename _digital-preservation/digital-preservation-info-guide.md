### Caring for Your Digital Collections

<h5>1. <u>Why do we preserve?</u></h5>

What will you do if, you are no longer able to view the photographs you have taken with your very first digital camera? Imagine how disappointing you will be if your university dissertation is “stuck” in an outdated word processing format and you aren’t able to retrieve it? Examples of these and many more of our personal documents not only chronicle meaningful milestones in our lives, they can also hold important information. 

Similarly, there may be serious consequences should the same happen in your professional life. For example, if you are an author or creative professional who, like so many people nowadays, had worked on their magnum opus on the computer, it would be upsetting if you are unable to access the drafts that had captured your creative process. 

As technology advances, some of these things may become irretrievable. To keep our memories for future generations, it is paramount that we actively preserve our digital content.

This guide offers useful tips on how you can ensure that your digital materials can be accessed in the future. 


<h5>2. <u>Identify what you want to preserve</u></h5>

Think of and look through all the different places where your digital materials could be stored. These could include: 

* Your laptops or desktop computers;
* Your camera;
* Your handphone;
* CDs;
* Diskettes / floppy disks;
* Cloud-based storage platforms (e.g. Google Drive, Google Photos)

Gather all the materials and examine the items in them. 


<h5>3. <u>Decide which items matter most</u></h5>

You can prioritise the items that are of the highest value to you or your family. These could be rare items or hold a lot of sentimental value. If you have more than one of the same items, prioritise saving the one that has the highest quality.


<h5>4. <u>Organise your digital content</u></h5>

Sometimes, you may encounter a huge array of files and not know how to find a photo from a certain occasion. Organising your digital content goes a long way for effective preservation. Below are some useful tips for organising your collection:

* Create a main folder for each collection, e.g. “My 16th Birthday” or “Wedding Anniversary.” Then, you can also create sub-folders labelled with simple titles like “documents,” “videos” and “photos”.[^1]
* Alternatively, you can create folders with items that are organised chronologically e.g. “April 2018” and “May 2018”.[^2]
* When labelling content, make the file name descriptive and include the date. Avoid spaces or special characters besides the underscore (_), as certain software may be unable to read files with such names.
* You can indicate file versions with suffixes like “v1,” “v2” and “vfinal”.[^3]

It would also be useful to record key information about your digital materials. The following are details you can consider recording:

* Number of items in each collection; 
* Title;
* Creator/author/contributor;
* Publisher/organiser;
* Type of content (e.g. still image, audio, video, text etc.);
* Short descriptions/captions/synopsis of content;
* Creation date of content (in YYYY/MM/DD format);
* Creation venue (if any);
* Country;
* Number of pages/sheets/duration of the audio-visual material;
* Photo/video/audio/publication credit or rights (if any) (in YYYY);
* Remarks/condition of items.
