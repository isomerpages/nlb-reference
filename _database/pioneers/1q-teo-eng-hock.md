### <u>Introduction</u>

Teo Eng Hock (张永福) (1872﹘1959) was a revolutionist, with ancestral roots in Raoping County in Guangdong province, China. He invested in rubber plantations during the early days and established a rubber shoe factory. His domination of the rubber shoe industry, along with Tan Kah Kee, in the early 20th century, provided him with the finances to support his revolutionary activities.

During the late Qing Period, Teo supported the reformists and was a member of the Chinese Philomatic Society. He became a revolutionist and later supported Sun Yat Sen and his revolutionary activities. Together with Tan Chor Lam, Teo set up and was the editor of the newspaper Thoe Lam Jit Poh. The newspaper folded after two years due to financial issues. Despite this, Teo continued to share his revolutionary ideas through the Sin Chew Reading Room. His bungalow, Wan Qing Yuan, also served as the headquarters of the revolutionists.

In 1906<sup>1</sup>, Sun Yat Sen established a Tongmenghui branch in Singapore with Teo as the deputy chairman. At the same time, Teo set up another newspaper, Union Times. However, control of the newspaper fell into other hands three months later, and the newspaper became an anti-revolution paper instead. Sun Yat Sen returned to Singapore from Japan in June 1906 to reorganise the Singapore branch and Teo became its chairman. In 1907, together with Tan Chor Lam and Lim Nee Soon, Teo again launched a newspaper, Chung Shing Yit Pao. He also established and headed the Tung Teh Reading Room that year.

After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Tongmenghui branch in Singapore became the Kuomintang branch in February 1912 with Teo as its honorary chairman. It was dissolved by the colonial government in 1926. In 1932, Teo returned to China and became involved in politics. He was appointed chief of the Central Bank in Swatow, mayor of the city and head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau. However, he subsequently became unhappy with the collaboration between the Kuomintang and Communists, and supported Wang Ching Wei instead. Teo became a member of the Central Supervisory Committee under the Central Government set up by Wang with the support of the Japanese in 1939. After the war, Teo was arrested by the Kuomintang as a traitor. After his release, he returned to Singapore and became a trustee of Ngee Ann Kongsi, and lived a reclusive life. He passed away in Hong Kong.

Teo’s daughter, Teo Soon Kim was the first female lawyer to be called to the Singapore Bar, and his great-grandnephew, Teo Chee Hean, has been Singapore’s deputy prime minister since 2009.
