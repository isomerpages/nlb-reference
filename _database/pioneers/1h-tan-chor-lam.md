### <u>Introduction</u>

Tan Chor Lam (陈楚楠, also known as Tan Lian Chye, 陈连才) (1884–1971), was the youngest son of Tan Tye, a wealthy merchant. Born in 1884 in Singapore, Tan received a private Chinese education and learned English and Malay at the same time.

Along with his childhood friend and neighbour, Teo Eng Hock, Tan Chor Lam was noted for his contributions towards the 1911 Chinese revolution. Both Tan and Teo set up a newspaper, Thoe Lam Jit Poh (图南日报), in 1904 to advocate revolutionary ideals. They first met Sun Yat Sen in 1905 through both the newspaper and an introduction from Yau Lit, and became Sun’s supporters.

When a branch of Zhongguo Tongmenghui (中国同盟会, Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) was set up in Singapore, Tan was elected as the president. A few months later, in a second election, he was elected as the vice-president and played an integral role in supporting Sun Yat Sen’s revolution. After the success of the revolution in 1911, Tan held various appointments in the Chinese government, such as Head of the Office for Industry in the Fujian Provincial Government. He gradually relinquished his involvement in China in 1932.

Tan Chor Lam had played a role in female education in Singapore. He founded the Nanyang Girls’ School with Teo Eng Hock, Chuang Hee Tsuan and others in 1917, and sat on the board of directors of the school for several years. He was also on the advisory committee to the British Military Administration in 1945. After World War II, he led a retired life largely focusing on his family and attended activities of United Chinese Library occasionally till his passing on 22 September 1971, aged 87..
