### <u>Introduction</u>

Lin Hengnan (林衡南) (birth and death years unknown), also known as Lim Kong Chuan (林光铨), was from Jinmen in Fujian Province, China.

Not much has been written about Lin apart from the fact that he owned a printing and publishing company called Koh Yew Hean Press (古友轩). His press was well-known for publishing two Chinese language newspapers and numerous publications in various languages, including English, Chinese and Malay. Lin came to Singapore in 1861 and picked up his printing skills from the British.

In 1877, Lin published a Chinese-Malay dictionary, Tong Yi Xin Yu (《通夷新语》). It became very popular and was reprinted in 1883 under the title Hua Yi Tong Yu (《华夷通语》), with a preface written by Tso Ping Lung, the first Chinese consul to Singapore appointed by the Qing imperial court.

Lin started printing a newspaper called Xing Bao (《星报》, also spelt Sing Pau, Sing Po or Sing Poh) in 1890, almost 10 years after the appearance of Lat Pau (《叻报》), the first Chinese newspaper in Singapore, in 1881. He mentioned in Xing Bao that he had been running his printing company for over 20 years, implying that the company could have been established in 1870 or earlier – making it possibly one of the earliest Chinese printing houses in Singapore. On average, Xing Bao enjoyed a daily circulation of 300 copies, reaching a peak of 970 copies in 1896. Xing Bao ceased publication in 1898 and Koh Yew Hean Press was subsequently put up for sale in October that same year.
