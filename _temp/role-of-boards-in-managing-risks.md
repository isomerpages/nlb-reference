### <u>Introduction</u>

In an increasingly vulnerable economic and social landscape, non-profit organisations (NPOs) and Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) are now playing a greater role in plugging social gaps, addressing social problems and meeting the needs of the under-served customer segments. Because of the trust that are placed on NPOs and VWOs, their Boards are expected to govern effectively and maintain credibility by:

* Establishing an effective risk governance and management framework.
* Maintaining higher ethical standards and win the trust and respect from donors, government and society for funding sustainability.
* Implementing controls to mitigate fraud risk and conduct grant programmes in accordance to grant conditions for donors and sponsors.
* Placing a risk management process to identify and mitigate operational risks related to programme events, volunteers and staffing which impacts the welfare of beneficiaries.
* Protecting the confidentiality of information provided by donors and mitigate leakage risks.
