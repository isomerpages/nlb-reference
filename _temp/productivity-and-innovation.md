Peter Drucker, who is widely acknowledged as the Father of modern business management, once said that increasing the productivity of workers in the knowledge society is “the most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century”. In order to stay competitive and relevant in the today’s global economy, many economies and organisations are moving up the value chain by increasing productivity and driving innovation.

### <u>Productivity</u>

Productivity involves the use of existing resources to achieve maximum results. In countries such as Singapore, where resources are limited, enhancing productivity has become the key to achieving economic growth. Thus, companies are increasingly encouraged to implement productivity-enhancing measures, including using automation and technology, improving supply chains and processes, and adopting standards.
