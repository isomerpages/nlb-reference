### <u>Introduction</u>

This resource guide is a step towards developing a practical and authoritative collection on social services for children and youth at the National Library Singapore and is useful for practitioners in the social service industry, educators, parents and caregivers working with children and youth.

Over 100 resources covering different aspects of social services for children and youth are listed under the following five categories:

**Categories**

1.	Services for children and youth (general)
2.	Children and youth with special needs
3.	Vulnerable children and youth
4.	Youths-at-risk
5.	Cyber wellness

These selected titles – which are listed alphabetically and grouped according to these five categories – cover the services, programmes and strategies which are aimed at enabling children and youth to have full and equitable access to learning and development opportunities which can help them to get a strong head start in life. Books that are unavailable at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and NLB’s public libraries have been denoted as such.

**Acknowledgements**
