Four Conversations is an annual signature programme by the National Library where thought leaders share new possibilities for the future, while inspiring lifelong learning and the creation of new knowledge.

This resource guide has been produced to complement the conversation on Sustainable Mobility. 

The speakers for the topic “Sustainable Mobility” are:



This session was moderated by Dr Limin Hee, Director at the Centre for Liveable Cities.

Transport is one of the main contributors to emissions, noise pollution and climate change.  Privately-owned, fossil fuel cars use hundreds of times more raw material than their battery electric equivalents.  They exacerbate transport problems including congestion, air pollution and urban space deficiency. The challenge of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and dealing with other sustainable issues calls for a change of the current mobility system. 

Smart mobility provides sustainable mobility and involves various innovations in information and communication technologies, ranging from high-tech solutions to data communication and software applications.  Such innovations enable a shift towards a more service-based mobility system, which makes urban transport more sustainable and environment friendly. Trends indicate a shift of ownership towards accessibility as well as the emergence of shared forms of mobility like ride-sharing and bike-sharing. Smart mobility also powers the development of automated mobility ranging from driving assistance to autonomously driving vehicles. The combination of the electrification of mobility, shared mobility, and automated mobility gives rise to the development of shared, autonomous, electric vehicles (SAEVs). SAEVS are expected to play a significant part in the transformation of the transport system.  Singapore is poised to become the global hub for autonomous transport technologies and a leader in the global smart mobility market.
