### <u>Introduction</u>

Occupational health is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as “the aspects of health and safety in the workplace, with a strong focus in the primary prevention of hazards”. Occupational safety and health (OSH) deals with the protection of the safety, health and well-being of employees in the workplace, as well as the promotion and maintenance of the physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations.

This is a selection of resources on open innovation available from the [NLB catalogue](http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/) or the Internet. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

### <u>Workplace Health and Safety</u>

Most people in the workforce spend many hours each day at their workplace, be it an office, studio, factory, plantation etc. Therefore, work environments should be kept safe and healthy for everyone. However, in reality, workers often face health hazards, both apparent or hidden, in their jobs. Work-related accidents or diseases can lead to pain and suffering for workers, and incur costs for the employers. Implementing OSH policies in the workplace can help to prevent work-related illness, injury or fatality amongst workers, and reduce costs for employers in terms of medical care, replacement and disability benefits.

### <u>Hazards at the workplace</u>

Physical hazards are factors in a workplace which can bring harm to the body with or without direct contact. These include chemical hazards, biological hazards, safety hazards and ergonomic hazards.

Examples of safety hazards include:

* working from heights
* machinery and moving machinery parts
* electrical hazards
* noise or lighting

Examples of biological hazards include:

* tainted blood or other body fluids
* fungi, bacteria and viruses

Examples of chemical hazards include:

* liquids such as paints, acids, solvents
* poisonous gases, vapours and fume
* flammable materials

Examples of ergonomic hazards include:

* incorrect sitting and standing postures
* lighting
* slippery surfaces


Besides physical hazards, workers may also face psychosocial hazards such as stress and bullying at the workplace. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines work-related stress as “the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope”.

Examples of psychosocial hazards include:

* excessive demands and pressures
* bullying
* harassment
