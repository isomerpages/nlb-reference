# Eye on Asia: Content & Resources  

[**Eye on Asia**](https://www.eyeonasia.gov.sg/) is a one-stop resource for anyone who wants to find out more about the region and explore international opportunities. Focusing on ASEAN countries, China and India as well as emerging cities, Eye on Asia provides a wide range of useful resources to increase awareness of developments in these countries and cities. 

Eye on Asia, a collaborative effort by National Library, Singapore and its partners, comprises an online portal as well as a resource centre at Level 7 of the National Library Building at 100 Victoria Street. The resource centre provides access to books and digital resources specially selected by librarians, and also runs regular programmes featuring entrepreneurs and people who have lived and worked abroad. 

The online portal is organised by country: 

 
## ASEAN Countries 

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (or ASEAN) is a community of 10 countries in Southeast Asia with diverse heritage and cultures. Geographically located within the tropics, these 10 nations collectively form one of the fastest-growing economic blocs in Asia with tremendous growth opportunities. 

 
## China 

China is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. A vast country with an ancient history, rich culture and natural beauty, China’s rise as a regional and global power in recent decades has also presented many business and learning opportunities. 

 

## India 

India is a diverse and vibrant nation that is home to the world’s second-largest population. It is one of the fastest-growing major economies today and its increasing economic prosperity and cultural dynamism make it an even more attractive destination. 

 

## Other Asian Countries 

Central Asia comprises the countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. With its important geo-strategic location between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Central Asia is receiving attention as an emerging market with high potential for growth and opportunities.  

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates in Asia. With its rich history, rapid growth, modern infrastructure and future-oriented initiatives, the UAE is an attractive nation to live and work in. 


Resources for each of these countries are categorised according to the themes of Know, Share and Go.
