# What is a Business Plan?  

A business plan is a document that explains a business’ objectives, the market it is in and how it intends to achieve its goals. It is a roadmap that details each stage of the business. A good plan will lay out the resources required and forecast financial results over a reasonable period. It will also describe the unique qualifications of the founder and management team. These plans can help businesses secure funding or attract new business partners. 

## Benefits of a business plan 

A sound business plan is needed when seeking external funding from banks, angel investors, and venture capitalists. Creditors and investors will take your plan more seriously when it is comprehensive, describing key elements of starting and running the business such as identifying your customers and outlining how you will turn a profit.   

Other reasons to develop a solid plan: 

*   A reality check and blueprint 
    

	*   Writing a plan helps you to think through the key elements of your business. 
    

	*   You will consider assumptions such as value proposition, competitive differentiation, staffing, partnerships and finances. 
    

*   Seeking advice 
    

	*   When you provide details of your plan to experienced outsiders for a review, they will be able to help you identify missed opportunities, invalid assumptions, overly optimistic projections and other weaknesses. 
    

*   Financial projections that can be used as an initial budget 
    

	*   When actual results fall short of planned results, it will prompt you to investigate and take corrective action.
