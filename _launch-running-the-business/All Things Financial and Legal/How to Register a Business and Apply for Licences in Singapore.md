# How to Register a Business and Apply for Licences in Singapore  

## Registering a business 

In Singapore, all businesses are generally required to register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Exemptions are granted for business owners who operate their businesses using their names as reflected in their NRICs.  

Watch this video summary on who needs to register their business with ACRA:

### Step 1: Decide on a business structure 

Singapore has four main types of business structures. You will need to understand the key differences between the structures and decide which is right for your business. 

The four business structures are:  

1.  Sole-proprietorship (one owner) or partnership (two or more owners) 
    
2.  Limited partnership (LP)  
    
3.  Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) 
    
4.  Company

### Step 2: Register a business name 

A business name is the name your business will use to operate. Before registering your business with ACRA, you need to register your business name. You can submit your new business name application via [BizFile+](http://www.bizfile.gov.sg/). The application fee is $15. 

Once the business name application is approved, it will be reserved for 120 days. You should register your business during this time as the business name will be released after the 120 days. 

How to choose a business name: 

*   Choose a name that would differentiate your business from others and help your customers to identify your business. 
    
*   Check the availability of your business name by conducting a search on ACRA’s business filing portal, [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx) 
    
*   Avoid using a name similar to an existing registered business  
    
*   Avoid names that are vulgar, obscene or offensive  
    
*   Avoid names that are prohibited by the Ministry of Finance

### Step 3: Choose a business address 

You must provide an address when registering your business with ACRA. P.O. Box addresses cannot be used. You must inform ACRA of any address change within 40 days of registration. 

There are three types of addresses:  

1.  Business address (for sole-proprietorships, partnerships and LPs) 
    
2.  Registered office address (for companies and LLPs) 
    
3.  Residential and alternative addresses

### Step 4: Submit your business registration application  

Submit your application via [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx). Alternatively, you may also appoint a registered filing agent to submit the application on your behalf. 

The application fee for sole proprietorships and partnerships, LP and LLP is $100. The application fee to incorporate a local company is $300.  

All applications are usually processed and approved within 15 minutes of the payment of application fee. Applications that need to be referred to another government agency may take 14 to 60 days to be processed and approved. 

## Applying for licences in Singapore 

Upon successful registration of your business entity, you may need to apply for a licence or permit from other government agencies before commencing business.
