## Introduction

At the end of World War Two, Korea was divided into two along the 38th parallel – the communist-occupied North (then called The People’s Democratic Republic of Korea) and the South (The Republic of Korea). The Korean War began on 25 June 1950, with the invasion of North Korea (supported by the Russians) in to the South and the capital, Seoul, fell to the communists in three days.

15 member countries (with American soldiers forming the bulk of the army) under the United Nations Security Council sent in troops in an attempt to end this war and ultimately stop the threat of Communist expansion into Asia. When the UN troops under General MacArthur advanced towards the north near the Chinese border at Yalu River, the Chinese Peoples Liberation Amy retaliated and forced the UN forces out of North Korea. Both sides faced a stalemate along the border separating the North and the South during the peace talks at Panmunjom that lasted for two years.

Two events in 1953 caused a breakthrough in the peace talks – the death of Joseph Stalin, Premier of the Soviet Union and the election of new US President, Dwight Eisenhower. An armistice signed in 1953 finally brought an end to a war that had lasted for three years (June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953). Casualties on both sides were heavy, with over 150,000 deaths among the UN troops and close to four million Korean civilians killed.

This section provides reference sources that discuss the causes of the Korean War, how and why it was exacerbated after the intervention of the UN forces and how a peace agreement was reached after three war-torn years.
