The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease, crossing international boundaries and affecting a large number of people.[^1] Before being classified as a pandemic, the outbreak is usually first labelled as an epidemic.[^2] Viruses that have caused past pandemics typically originated from animal influenza viruses.[^3] 

While these viruses may cause symptoms similar to those of the seasonal flu or common cold – such as a cough and fever[^4]- the population would not have immunity against it. This results in severe illness and even death for a large number of individuals. Those with compromised immune systems, co-morbidities and the elderly are at the highest risk.[^5]

The 20th century has seen three influenza pandemics, each being the result of a new type of Influenza A virus. The most severe was the Spanish Flu, which took place between 1918 and 1919. Caused by an A(H1N1) virus, it claimed the lives of an estimated 20 to 50 million people. In the second half of the 20th century, the Asian Flu (1957–58), caused by an A(H2N2) virus, and the Hong Kong Flu (1968), caused by an A(H3N2) virus, took the lives of an estimated one to four million people respectively. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002 to 2003 and the Swine Flu (H1N1) in 2009 were the more recent pandemics.[^6] 

Lessons from previous pandemics such as the Spanish Flu and SARS outbreak suggest that social distancing measures and international cooperation are the most effective methods to slow down the spread of COVID-19.[^7]

The previous package explored the outbreak of the Spanish Flu in 1918. To learn more about other major pandemics after the Spanish Flu, check out the resources listed below. Look out for our next instalment where we will look at vaccinations.
