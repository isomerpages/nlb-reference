### <u>Introduction</u>

The 21st century is projected to be the Asian century, where Asia will become the engine of global economic growth with its two largest countries, China and India, becoming economic powerhouses. China is projected to overtake the United States in 2028 in market exchange rate (MER) terms despite its projected growth slowdown, and India is seen to have the potential to become the second largest economy in the world by 2050 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. In addition to China and India, Asia also has the former economic powerhouse, Japan; an increasingly affluent South Korea; and the fast-growing economies of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Several countries with large populations will have increased buying power as their economies expand and grow. This extra consumer purchasing power will offer economic opportunities for foreign companies to expand overseas. The economic opportunities offered by Asia can be capitalised by Singaporeans by taking a greater interest in the culture and history of the region; by being aware of the rapid changes in Asia; and by being more willing to take risks and invest in the region.

Asian values such as tolerance and social stability are believed to have played a part in the economic progress of some countries in the region. Confucian values are seen to be the foundation of the social, cultural and economic success of the region in the last few decades.

This resource guide showcases articles and reports on the economic growth and opportunities offered by Asia in the coming decades that can be useful in thinking about how young Singaporeans can be encouraged to adopt a positive world view of Asia and the economic potential it offers.

 

### <u>Asia 2050: Realising the Asian century</u>

This article highlights that if Asia continues to follow its recent trajectory, by 2050 its per capita income could rise sixfold in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) to reach Europe’s levels. By nearly doubling its share of global gross domestic product (GDP) to 52 percent by 2050, Asia is expected to “regain the dominant economic position it held some 300 years ago, before the industrial revolution.” The article suggests that the continuing rapid growth of Asian economies over the next 40 years will require a harnessing of the full potential of technology, innovation, and critically, entrepreneurship.

### <u>Packing a mightier punch: Asia’s economic growth among global markets continues</u>

This article argues that once a poorer cousin of the United States and Europe, Asia now boasts some of the world’s fastest-growing economies and is a major contributor to global growth. In addition to China and India, Asia also has a former powerhouse in Japan, an increasingly affluent South Korea, and the fast-growing Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). It contends that the more one looks at Asia, the clearer it becomes that the region’s ascendancy in the global economy will continue, providing strength and economic opportunities in the future.

### <u>Asia’s rise is rooted in Confucian values</u>

This article argues that states like China, South Korea and Singapore became economic powerhouses by relying on the old tenets of tolerance and social stability. The founders of modern Asian states like South Korea’s Park Chung-hee, Taiwan’s Chiang Kai-shek and Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew are said to have been “very consciously Confucian as they navigated the rigours of creating modern societies.” Confucian values are seen to be the foundation of one of the social, cultural and economic success stories of the last few decades.

### <u>The world in 2050: Will the shift in global economic power continue?</u>

This report describes a dramatic shift in global economic power away from advanced economies and towards Asia and a block of faster-growing emerging economies.

It highlights that:

* The shift in global economic power away from the established advanced economies in North America, Western Europe and Japan will continue over the next 35 years.
* China has already overtaken the US in 2014 to become the largest economy in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. In market exchange rate (MER) terms, China is projected to overtake the US in 2028 despite its projected growth slowdown.
* India has the potential to become the second largest economy in the world by 2050 in PPP terms (third in MER terms), although this requires a sustained programme of structural reforms.
* New emerging economies like Mexico and Indonesia are projected to overtake the United Kingdom and France by 2030 (in PPP terms) while Turkey could overtake Italy.
* Nigeria and Vietnam could be the fast growing large economies over the period to 2050.
* Colombia, Poland and Malaysia possess great potential for sustainable long-term growth in the coming decades.

### <u>Emerging economies to keep an eye on for investment</u>

This article highlights that the three emerging markets to consider investing in for future growth are China, India and Indonesia. With its economy growing at a rate of four percent, and its population moving from rural to urban areas with increasing incomes, China is a dominant economy and market in the long-run for investors. India’s current government has been aggressively pushing for changes to make business easier. Specifically one of the changes it made was to allow more foreign investment into Indian companies, which will bring in increased capital for expansion. With eased permit access for land use activities and reason to keep money in the country, Indonesia is seen to have the potential for fast expansion.

### <u>Growth drivers in Asia and Singapore</u>

In his speech at the UBS Wealth Insights Conference on 16 January 2016, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Finance, highlighted that the growth in Asian emerging markets as a whole is projected to average six percent from 2015 to 2020. He noted that a growing middle-class, encouraged to consume more, would provide the internal impetus for growth. Even though the six percent growth rate was not high by historical standards, Asia was expected to continue outperforming the rest of the world by a significant margin. He called on Singaporeans to have the innovative agility and outward orientation that is needed to carry them through these emerging scenarios. He suggested that they should recognise and make the most of the opportunities, even as they stayed mindful of risks.
