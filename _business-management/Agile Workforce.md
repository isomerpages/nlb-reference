# Agile Workforce

Today’s workforce faces multiple challenges, such as skill shortages, rapid technological advances and ever-growing competitive markets. Disruptions, such as those caused by the Covid-19 pandemic further drive the importance that the workforce needs to evolve and be more agile to respond to these challenges. Workforce agility is vital to the future success of organisations.

An agile workforce can swiftly “adapt and change with the growing and shifting needs of businesses”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  to be more effective, responsive, resilient, and competitive even during volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous times.

#### History of Agile Practices

Agile practices emerged from the software developer community in 2001. A group of software developers had gathered in Snowbird, Utah, to share and refine their approaches to software development and depart from the waterfall way of building software. They sought to create processes that would provide more flexibility and accelerate developers’ efforts to produce software of the highest quality reliably. During this meeting, the Agile Manifesto was developed. 

Today, agile practices have expanded beyond the IT industry to other types of industries and organisations.  


#### Embarking on an Agile Transformation

Future-proofing the workforce through agile demands a comprehensive shift in all areas –organisational structure, people, process, and technology. It is transformational and challenging and requires continuous improvement and optimisation. 

The advantages of agility include: 
* Improves competitive edge; 
* Ability to evolve and thrive even in fluid external environments;
* Flexibility to quickly pivot and adapt to challenging or new environments; 
* Always ready to adopt new technologies; and
* Always ready to learn and acquire new skills to capitalise on new opportunities. 

<i><u>Organisational Transformation</u></i>
<br>
An agile organisation comprises “a network of high-performing teams within a people-centred culture that operates in rapid learning and fast decision cycles, which are enabled by technology and a common purpose that creates value for all stakeholders.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Agile organisations are robust (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble, and adaptive). 

Organisations that have embarked on the agile transformation reported the following benefits:
* Commercial benefits – Improved speed to market, adaptability, revenues, customer satisfaction and higher quality products
* Workforce-related benefits – Improved employee engagement, transparency and communications and reduction of silos
* Organisational benefits – Improved team autonomy, productivity, clear goals and cultivated a culture of experimentation and innovation

The core of organisational agility is a strong commitment by the leadership that directs and enables action in adopting agile practices. They are also responsible for building and instilling an agile culture of respect, trust, learning, and autonomy, which requires dedicated effort. 

Other critical aspects of agility include: 
* Redesigning and redefining organisational structures, processes, and technology to support behavioural expectations;
* Investing and prioritising reskilling and upskilling programmes for employees; and 
* Engaging the employees and developing clear, effective, transparent and regular communication


<i><u>Worker Transformation</u></i>
<br>
Personal transformation requires a disciplined approach from individual workers to maintain competitiveness and versatility. A mindset shift, the foundation of agility, is critical. 

An agile mindset is a flexible way of thinking that enables people to react quickly and adapt to changing situations. It comprises the drive to innovate and deliver customer value. Workers need to embrace risk and continually experiment, test, and learn. 

Reskilling and upskilling are also incredibly important to ensure that workers are prepared and ready when new skills and roles become available. Workers need to embrace a culture of continuous learning where they need to learn, unlearn, and relearn to keep up with the fast-changing business needs and environment.
