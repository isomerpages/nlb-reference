### <u>Introduction</u>

A strategic plan functions as a roadmap for an organisation to chart its organisational priorities, define operational goals and align resources to support the strategic planning framework. The board’s responsibility is to set the direction, steer the organisation through the strategic planning process, analyse operating costs, set budget targets and develop performance indicators to track progress and achievements. Ultimately, the strategic framework reflects the shared vision of both the organisation and the board and documents the commitment of the board members and staff to the priorities outlined in the plan.

This guide provides recommended resources on the topic of strategic planning for nonprofit organisations that are available from NLB as well as on the Internet. As the guide is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources.
