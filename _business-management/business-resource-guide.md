### <u>Economics and International Economics</u>

Economics is the study of how resources are utilised. It looks at the decisions people make on how limited resources are allocated in order to meet the demands with highest optimisation. Economic principles, theories and models describe the creation, production, consumption, transfer and distribution of wealth. Scarcity, the imbalance between limited resources and demands, is one of the main drivers in economics. In the context of a country, resources could come in the form of human, capital, natural resources and technology. For an individual, resources could refer to money, skills, talents and time.
