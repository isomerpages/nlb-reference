##### Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most significant technologies today. In general, the field of AI seeks to create machines with human-like characteristics.

From automation to augmentation and beyond, AI is changing how business gets done and offering great potential to benefit the whole of society. Many CEOs agree that AI will markedly change the way they do business. AI has enabled companies such as Google and Apple to become among the largest in the world.

#### Will AI lead to mass unemployment?

Will AI result in an underclass of people who become unemployable because computers are doing their jobs? Experts opine that it is unlikely that AI will lead to mass unemployment. Like all previous labour-saving technologies, AI will enable new industries to form, creating more new jobs than are lost to the technology.

For the foreseeable future, AI will not lead to computers replacing people, but people and computers working together to perform cognitive and physical tasks that could not be done before. 

#### How will work change with AI?

AI has huge potential to increase productivity growth and contribute to the global economy. AI will increase the number of tasks that computers can do faster, less costly, or better than people.

The ability to adapt to entire novel situations is a major challenge for AI and robotics, and a main reason why companies still need human workers for a variety of tasks. Human workers are valuable and excel at social interaction, unpredictable physical skills, common sense, and general intelligence.

In the foreseeable future, there are some opportunities for AI in tasks such as:
* Sensing. AI systems today are already good at analysing many kinds of images, sounds, motions, and other inputs.
* Creating. Many kinds of creation involve patterns that machines can learn. The GPT-3 system (which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), for example, is trained to generate human-like text.

#### How can AI and humans collaborate?

Studies show that augmentation is a more desirable and common outcome than large-scale automation. Augmentation occurs when workplaces combine smart machines with humans in close partnerships, symbiotically leveraging both human intelligence and machine intelligence. Worker augmentation reinforces the belief that technology is not replacing human labour en masse anytime soon.

AI is used as a tool to complement the capabilities of a human worker. AI systems are better than humans at certain tasks such as crunching numbers, identifying patterns, and recalling information. Humans are better than AI systems at tasks that require general intelligence such as non-routine reasoning and defining abstractions, as well as interpersonal and physical skills. By collaborating, AI systems and humans can augment and complement each other’s skills.
