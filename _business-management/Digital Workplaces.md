A 2019 report found that 48 percent of staff in the United States already worked from home at least once a week.[^1] In Singapore, employers have been gradually adopting telecommuting. From 2013 to 2018, the proportion of employers providing formal telecommuting arrangements grew from 5 to 8 percent, whereas between 17 to 18 percent of employers allowed ad-hoc tele-working when necessary.[^2]

Many corporate functions have begun to shift onto digital, online or even cloud platforms, allowing employees to access these functions from home or even the café across the street. Telecommuting  can afford employees more free time, giving them the flexibility to work comfortably and achieve work-life balance. However, there are concerns of falling productivity, lack of effective communication, negative impact to company and team culture, and a blurring of lines between work and home. Hence, many work-related productivity apps, guides and books have been produced to help ease the transition into digital workspaces. If implemented effectively, businesses and teams can come out stronger, with the agility and flexibility for work to be done regardless of location or time.
