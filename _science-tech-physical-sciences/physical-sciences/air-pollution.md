## Introduction

Air pollution is the accumulation in the atmosphere of substances that, in sufficient concentrations, degrade ecosystems, damage buildings and endanger human health. Most air pollution is caused by human activities, but there are some natural sources of air pollution such as wildfires or volcanic ash.[^1]

[^1]: Air pollution. (2011, April 4). *National Geographic*. Retrieved February 4, 2021 from <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/air-pollution/>

Some common air pollutants are soot, smoke, mold, pollen, methane and carbon dioxide. These can reach harmful concentrations both indoors and outdoors. Tiny particles smaller than 10 micrometers (classified as PM10 and PM2.5) can even be breathed into our lungs and into our bloodstream. Air pollution has caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, about 90% of them in low- and middle-income countries.[^2] Air pollution has been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and other respiratory diseases.

Beyond individual health, air pollution is known to have direct impacts on our environment. Climate change, global warming, ozone layer depletion, smog and acid rain are some effects of air pollution. Singapore has encountered situations with heavy haze in the past as well.

Internationally, countries have begun working together to reduce air pollution and improve air quality worldwide. Renewable energy and zero-emission alternatives to vehicles and machines are being developed and implemented. Governments have also made commitments to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases, through agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Kigali Agreement.[^3]

### Journal Articles

(*myLibrary ID* is required to access the journal articles from [NLB’s eresources website](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/){:target="blank"})

**Experience from Integrated Air Quality Management in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and Singapore**

Molina, L. T., Velasco, E., Retama, A., & Zavala, M. (2019). Experience from Integrated Air Quality Management in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and Singapore. *Atmosphere,* *10*(9). Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [Proquest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

This article reviews the air quality and compares the policies implemented in both the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and Singapore. While differences in the governance, economics, and culture of the two cities influence the decision-making process, both have made progress in reducing concentrations of harmful pollutants by implementing comprehensive integrated air quality management programs. Findings offer insights into the complexity of managing air pollution to protect public health and the environment.



**Gasping for air**

Gasping for air. (2019, Sep 21). *The Economist,* *432*, 64. Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [Proquest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

Haze in Indonesia and Malaysia is thought to have caused more than 200,000 respiratory infections and prompted the closure of 1,500 schools, and the thick smoke could even disrupt air traffic. Indonesia's environment and forestry is cracking down hard on the illegal forest clearing method, but the government could be tougher yet. 



**Impacts of Climate Change and Air Pollution on the Tourism Industry: Evidence from Southeast Asia**

Nguyen, T. G. (2019). Impacts of Climate Change and Air Pollution on the Tourism Industry: Evidence from Southeast Asia. *Journal of Environmental Management & Tourism,* *10*(8), 1711-1722. Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [Proquest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

This paper examines the effects of climate change and air pollution on the tourism industry in Southeast Asia. Findings show that air pollution has a negative effect on total tourist arrivals, with nitrous oxide emission being the key driver. These results suggest that governments may need to make critical policy decisions to weigh between short-term economic growth and long-term environmental improvement to enhance tourist destination quality in the future.



**Particulate air pollution on cardiovascular mortality in the tropics: impact on the elderly**

Yap, J., Ng, Y., Yeo, K. K., Sahlén, A., Lam, C. S. P., Lee, V., & Ma, S. (2019). Particulate air pollution on cardiovascular mortality in the tropics: impact on the elderly. *Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source*, *18*(34). Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1329/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

Air pollution has a significant health impact, and this study examines the health impact of air pollution, particularly among the elderly, in a tropical region. Contemporary population-based data from an equatorial country with tropical climate show that exposure to particulate air pollution was significantly associated with non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly.



**Southeast Asia's transboundary haze pollution: Unravelling the inconvenient truth**

Zhang, J. J., & Savage, V. R. (2019). Southeast Asia’s transboundary haze pollution: Unravelling the inconvenient truth. *Asia Pacific Viewpoint*, *60*(3), 355–369. Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1329/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

This paper examines the political intricacies inherent in the management of Southeast Asia's transboundary haze pollution. The 'environment' takes on different meanings at each scale, and both Indonesia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) need to recognise this in order to engage more effectively with the transboundary environmental issue. The paper calls for a greater awareness of structural weaknesses in the management of forest resources and a change in ASEAN's environmental paradigm to a more holistic ecosystem perspective that prioritises not just environmental and human health, but also a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. 



**The Impacts of Air Pollution on Health and Economy in Southeast Asia**

Taghizadeh-Hesary, F., & Taghizadeh-Hesary, F. (2020). The Impacts of Air Pollution on Health and Economy in Southeast Asia. *Energies,* *13*(7), 1812. Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [Proquest Central](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse/resource/1111/){:target="blank"} via NLB’s eResources website.

Ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use has a latent cost, that is public health issues such as respiratory diseases, lung cancer and long-term economic burdens. In Southeast Asia, lung cancer are leading causes of cancer-related deaths. This study uses 2000-2016 data for ten Southeast Asian countries to examine the possible associations between emissions, lung cancer, and the economy. Results confirm that CO2 and PM2.5 are major risk factors for lung cancer in the region. However, increased use of renewable energy and higher healthcare expenditure tends to reduce lung cancer prevalence.



**The Relationship Between Air Pollution and All-Cause Mortality in Singapore**

Ho, A. F. W., Zheng, H., Cheong, K. H., En, W. L., Pek, P. P., Zhao, X., Morgan, G. G., Earnest, A., Tan, B. Y. Q., Ng, Y. Y., Foo, L. L., & Ong, M. E. H. (2020).

Retrieved 2021, February 23, from [https://www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/11/1/9/htm){:target="blank"}

Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for both acute and chronic diseases and poses serious health threats to the world population. This study examines the relationship between air pollution and all-cause mortality in the context of a city-state exposed to the Southeast Asian haze problem. Findings provide evidence on the general health hazard of exposure to air pollution, which can potentially guide public health policies in the region.



**Urban and air pollution: a multi-city study of long-term effects of urban landscape patterns on air quality trends**

Liang, L., & Gong, P. (2020). Urban and air pollution: a multi-city study of long-term effects of urban landscape patterns on air quality trends. *Scientific Reports*, *10*(1), 1-13.
