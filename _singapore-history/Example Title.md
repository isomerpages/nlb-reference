Sinnathamby Rajaratnam is best known as Singapore’s first Minister for Culture and, after independence in 1965, Singapore’s first Minister for Foreign Affairs. In these two positions, and in other offices in a long subsequent political career, Rajaratnam theorized Singaporean multiculturalism, and developed a national foreign policy. His speeches and commentaries while in Government are well known, and many have been reproduced in two collections, The Prophetic and the Political, edited by Chan Heng Chee and Obaid ul Haq, and S. Rajaratnam on Singapore: From Ideas to Reality, edited by Kwa Chong Guan. Rajaratnam’s short stories, written during his sojourn in London during the Second World War, and six radio plays he wrote in the 1950s, have also been collected in Irene Ng’s The Short Stories and Radio Plays of S. Rajaratnam. The majority of Rajaratnam’s writings before he entered the first People’s Action Party cabinet on 5 June 1959, however, were published in newspapers and magazines during his career as a journalist. Few of these are listed in bibliographical sources: Gandhimathy Durairaj and Linda Yip Seong Chun’s S. Rajaratnam: A Bibliography, for instance, makes scant reference to material before 1959.
