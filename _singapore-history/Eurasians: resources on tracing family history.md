### The Eurasian Community in Singapore

<p>Eurasians are one of Singapore’s four major ethnic groups. Carrying a
pedigree of European and Asian, the Eurasians are also Singapore’s earliest
ethnic communities. The origins of the Eurasians in Singapore can be traced
to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from the various European
settlements in the region such as Malacca, Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao
and Penang in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Of significance were the Portuguese,
Dutch and British. But it also included the European ancestries of Danish,
French, German, Italian and Spanish though to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The first Eurasians arrived in Singapore shortly after Sir Stamford Raffles
landed on the island in 1819. Similar to other ethnic groups, the Eurasians
of early Singapore lived in communal enclaves. One of the earliest known
Eurasian enclaves was situated in the Waterloo area, along the three roads
of Waterloo Street, Queen Street and Bencoolen Street running parallel
to each other. The houses in the area varied from bungalows to terrace
houses and from shophouses to two-storey homes. As the early Singapore-Eurasians
were Christians, it was no surprise to find them attending churches and
schools in the area. Some of the most notably churches and schools in the
Waterloo area included the Church of Saint Peter and Paul, Saint Joseph
Church, Cathedral of Good Shepherd, and Saint Joseph Institution. As the
Singapore-Eurasian community expanded, they began to fan out to other residential
areas such as Serangoon, Haig Road, Bukit Timah and Katong.</p>
<p>A distinct Singapore-Eurasian identity began to emerge towards the end
of the 1800s when the Eurasians began forming associations to consolidate
themselves and to look after the interests of their community. From the
1880s to the start of the Second World War, there were four main organisations
to which Eurasians affiliated themselves. These were the Singapore Recreation
Club (1883), the Eurasian Association (1919), the Girls’ Sports Club (1929)
and the Eurasian Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps. In addition,
the Eurasian community also established a number of newspapers since the
1870s as a means to voice their sentiments. Some of these newspapers included
the Straits Intelligence, the Singapore Eurasian Advocate, the Daily Advertiser
(later renamed the Phoenix Press), and the Midday Herald (later renamed
the Straits Telegraph).</p>
<p>Apart from associations and organisations, the Singapore-Eurasian community
also derived some of their cultural identity and sense of community from
the rituals and customs they followed. For Eurasians who are Christians,
the most important festivals are naturally Christmas and Easter. For other
Eurasians who have different faith, they would follow the celebrations
of that particular faith. As with any other community groups the Singapore-Eurasian
community also has their own culture that cuts across areas ranging from
costumes to food.</p>
<p>Due to their fluency in the English language and their European heritage,
the common places of employment for the Eurasians were mainly in the civil
service and the municipality taking on jobs in government departments such
as the Department of Education, Registry of Vehicles, the Police Force
or the Government Monopolies Department (Customs department). Many Eurasians
also served as engineers with the Keppel Harbour Docks and the Singapore
Slipway, while others entered journalism, broadcasting or the private sector
joining established banks and companies such as Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank, Shell Company, Dunlop, Boustead and Adamson Gilfillan. Besides these
professional positions, many Eurasians who obtained education through government
scholarship or family support were among the first lawyers, doctors and
university lecturers in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>Similar to other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Singapore-Eurasian
community produced prominent figures and leaders who contributed in major
ways to their own community and Singapore in general. During the colonial
period, Eurasian leaders such as Edwin John Tessensohn, Noel Leicester
Clarke, Claude Henry da Silva and Percival Frank Aroozoo were instrumental
in strengthening the communal bond and welfare among Eurasians either through
various community works or by representing them in the Legislative Council
or the Straits Settlements Association, while others like Charles Joseph
Pemberton Palgar led the Eurasian community through the Japanese Occupation
and tended to the inhabitants of the failing Eurasian community at Bahau.
Many prominent Eurasians were involved in Singapore’s struggle for independence
as well as the crucial years after independence. Some of them who had taken
key roles in the government and civil service included Edward William Barker,
George Edwin Bogaars, Hedwig Anuar and Dr. Benjamin Henry Shears.</p>
<p>The post-independence era also saw the Eurasians rebuilt their community
bond slowly. In the late 1950s, women were granted membership to the Eurasian
Association and Youth groups were formed to encourage community bonding
through sports and cultural exchanges. However it was only after 1989 that
the Eurasians took on more sustainable efforts through the Eurasian Association
to rekindle the sense of belonging shared among the Eurasians, especially
the younger generation. In fact, 1989 for the Eurasian Association was
known as the year of the Eurasian Awakening as a younger group of Eurasians
decided to take the lead to uplift the community. It was a turning point
as membership of Eurasian Association began to increase, and more elaborate
community bonding programmes and activities were introduced. Furthermore,
it also generated research interest among some Eurasians to trace the community
or their own Eurasian heritage.</p>
<p>To understand the Singapore-Eurasian community and its heritage, this
resource guide lists out the relevant resources and materials that are
found within the collections of the National Library and the National Archives
of Singapore. It also identifies some authoritative resources that can
be found in the web.</p>

### **Origins of the Singapore Eurasians**
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tracing the Roots of the Singapore Eurasians</strong>
</p>
<p>The ancestries of Singapore-Eurasians could be traced to the European
traders, explorers and administrators who at different periods between
the 16<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries followed the growth of
the trade route between Europe and Asia to take up residency in European
settlements in India, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, the Malay Archipelago, Indo-China
and China. During their residency, some of these European settlers chose
to intermarry and establish families with the native population, thus giving
rise to a Eurasian identity. The European groups that mainly make up the
European ancestries of Singapore-Eurasians were the Portuguese, Dutch and
British. It also includes the French, Spanish, German, Danish, Italian
but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>This section lists out the resources that will help us trace the origins
of the Singapore-Eurasian community. It focuses on the three major European
groups – Portuguese, Dutch and British – that made up the Eurasian community
in Singapore. The resources that are listed in this section can be found
in the National Library collection as well as the web.</p>

<p><strong>Eurasians of Portuguese Decent - Kristang</strong>
</p>
<p>Kristang, or Papiah Kristang, is a Creole language born from the contacts
between speakers of Portuguese and speakers of local and other languages
at the time. Kristang can trace its origins to Portugal’s conquest of the
maritime trade routes and the establishment of numerous trading posts along
these routes in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, particularly Malacca. In fact,
Kristang was the language often used by the Portuguese <em>casado</em> class
or the <em>mestico</em> population (Portuguese married to local women loyal
to the Portuguese Crown) in Malacca. Today, Kristang is still used by people
of Portuguese descent in Malacca and elsewhere in Malaysia and Singapore.
Below are examples of Kristang phrases and words.</p>

<p><strong>Portuguese Surnames</strong>
</p>
<p>Portuguese commoners did not have fixed hereditary surnames until the
use and registry of surnames were enforced in Portugal in 1755. Prior to
then, hereditary surnames were only used by the Portuguese nobilities as
means to convey lineage. However, most Portuguese had names in addition
to their given names as identifiers. These identifying names originated
from various naming customs that were common in both Portugal and the rest
of Europe. One of the most common naming conventions was patronymics where
a personal name was based on the name of one's father. For instance, names
such as Henriques, Rodrigues and Fernandes are derived from patronymics
as the suffix “-es” means “son of”. As a result, Henriques means son of
Henriques, while Rodrigues and Fernandes mean son of Rodrigo and son of
Fernando. In Spanish patronymics, the suffix is “-ez” instead of “-es”.</p>
<p>Similar to naming practices in other parts of Europe, identifying names
could also derive from the individual’s place of origin, trades, characteristics
and physical attributes. Therefore, it is common to see prepositions such
as “de”, “da”, “das” or “dos” in Portuguese names. These prepositions are
contractions of the preposition “de” which is Portuguese for “from the”
or “of the”. Some examples of these names are de Sousa (from Sousa), da
Silva (from the woods), and dos Santos (of the saints). Identifying names
with religious meaning are also common among the Portuguese. A possibility
why individuals adopted such names could be because he or she wanted to
demonstrate their Catholic faith. Examples of such names are <em>da Conceição</em> (of
the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary), <em>Pascoal</em> (of Easter)
and <em>Ramos</em> (branches, from Palm Sunday).</p>
<p>After surnames were enforced, Portuguese commoners started to use these
identifying names as their hereditary surnames. As Portuguese law allows
each individual to have up to six names (two given names and four surnames),
it is common for a Portuguese to include the surnames from his or her paternal
and maternal families.</p>

<p><strong>Portuguese Roots</strong>
</p>
<p>Examination of Singapore-Eurasian roots must begin with the Portuguese
as they were the first to establish settlements in Asia in places such
as Goa, Ceylon, Malacca and Macau in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century.
With the object to propagate a local population that was loyal to the Portuguese
crown in these settlements, marriages between Portuguese settlers and native
women were encouraged. Some of these Portuguese-Eurasian families that
were established through this union who would later migrate to Singapore
included the names Cardoza (Goa), Fernando (Ceylon), de Souza (Malacca),
Oliveira (Malacca), da Silva (Macau) and Noronha (Macau). The language
that they used was Portuguese Creoles. In Malacca, however, it was Kristang.
As for religion, the Portuguese-Eurasians were mostly Roman Catholics.
Depending on where they were located, Portuguese-Eurasians were known as <em>Luso-Indian</em> (India), <em>Kristang </em>(Malacca)
or <em>Macanese</em> (Macau). They were also called <em>Mestico</em> or <em>Filhos da terra</em> (children
of the land) in general.</p>

<p>When the Portuguese seafarer Afonso de Albuquerque conquered the bustling
port of Malacca in 1511, he effectively gained control of the entire South
China Sea spice trade. Although their dominance lasted only 130 years,
the Portuguese legacy lies at the heart of a burgeoning tourist attraction
on the outskirts of the city, in which performers who believe they are
the descendants of swashbuckling Portuguese conquerors encapsulate their
"history" in a cultural stage show. Using historical and ethnographic data,
Margaret Sarkissian reveals that this music and dance draws on an eclectic
array of influences that span the Portuguese diaspora.</p>

<p><strong>Eurasians of Dutch Descent</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Burghers</strong>
</p>
<p>The Burghers are a Eurasian ethnic group, historically from Sri Lanka,
consisting for the most part of the male-line descendants of the European
colonists and of the maternal ancestry of Sinhalese and Tamil. The term
"Burgher" was first introduced by the Dutch to identify the mixed Eurasian
people in Ceylon when they took over the island from the Portuguese. It
comes from the Dutch word Burger, meaning "citizen" or "resident". People
of mixed ancestry were not allowed citizenship of the country of their
European fathers, nor of their Asian mothers, so a compromise was found
whereby they would be citizens of the towns of their birth, and they were
known as "Burgers".</p>

<p><strong>Dutch Surnames</strong>
</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the Dutch nobilities had been using fixed surnames
to denote their hereditary lineage as early as the 16<sup>th</sup> century.
However, this practice was adopted by the commoners until much later. Nonetheless,
the commoners used names in addition to their given names in order to identify
themselves. One common naming method, which goes back to the 15<sup>th</sup> century,
was the using patronymic names. Patronymic means the child’s last name
would be a form of the father’s given name. Thus, Claus, son of Barent,
would be Claus Barents or Claus Barentsz, Barentsen or Barentszen, depending
on how certain regions used abbreviate the “z” in “zoon,” Dutch for “son”.</p>
<p>Other naming methods that the Dutch commonly used were by the individual’s
place of origin, their physical attributes, characteristics and trades.
As a result, many Dutch names have prepositions like “van”, “van der”,
or “de” which are Dutch for “of”, “of the” and “the” respectively. Some
examples of these names are van Dyke (of the dike), van der Bilt (from
the hill), de Wit (the white) and de Groot (the great).</p>
<p>The Dutch commoners only started to use these names as their hereditary
surnames after the introduction of the civil registry in which all persons
were required to have a fixed surname in 1811. Some of these names would
undergo some variations after the families left Netherlands to settle in
the colonies. For example, those who settled in the British colonies changed
the spelling of their surnames to adapt to the English sound set. For instance,
Filips becomes Philips while Abels becomes Ables.</p>

<p><strong>Dutch Roots</strong>
</p>
<p>When the Dutch took over the Portuguese in Malacca and Ceylon in the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century,
they also established Eurasian families with local or existing Portuguese-Eurasian
population. Baumgarten, Cornelius, de Vries, Klass, Klassen, Koek, Kraal,
Velge and Westerhout were some of the Dutch-Eurasian family names that
took root in Malacca. On the other hand, the family names Bartholomeusz,
Bogaars, Ebert, Fruigtneit, Leembruggen, Scharenguivel, van Cuylenburg
and van Geyzel were the Eurasians of Dutch descent originating in Ceylon
or the <em>Burghers</em>. Dutch-Eurasian families carrying names like Yzelman
were also established in the Dutch East Indies and were referred to as <em>Indo-Dutch</em> or <em>Indos</em>.
Despite their Dutch heritage, some of the Dutch-Eurasians, particularly
those in Malacca, spoke Portuguese Creoles with some even considered themselves
as Portuguese-Eurasians. Otherwise, the Dutch-Eurasians would maintain
their Dutch heritage and remain as Protestant. For the two groups of Dutch-Eurasians,
they would later found their way to Singapore.</p>

<p>Published as a contribution by the Malaysian Dutch descendants to commemorate
Malaysia's 50 years of independence, the theme of my book focuses on the
mutual heritage shared between Malaysia and the Netherlands. It also tells
about ties of friendship, diplomacy and commerce shared between the Dutch

at Batu Sawar, Johor. The book includes a history of the Netherlands which
lead to the founding of the Dutch East India Company; the first contact
between the Dutch and the Malays in Johor; capture of Malacca, relationships
between the Protestant Dutch and the Roman Catholic Portuguese-Eurasians
in Dutch Malacca; their attempts to enhance trade, maintain diplomacy and
create an equilibrium of power in the Straits; as well as an insight to
the Dutch Admirals, Burghers, Governors and their administrative ranks
in shaping Malaysia's history.</p>

memoirs provide vignettes of Indonesian life, both rural and urban, as
seen through the eyes of the author first as a girl, then as a wife separated
from her husband during the Japanese occupation, finally as an immigrant
to the United States after World War II. This self-portrait gives glimpses
of the life of Indos from inside their society, glimpses that are valuable

<p><strong>Eurasians of British Descent</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The term "Eurasians"</strong>
</p>
<p>The term “Eurasian” was coined by the British. It is said to be used around
1820 to describe the people of European-Asian mixed blood descent. Prior
to then, the group was referred to by the British as Anglo-Indians, Indon-Britons
or even Christian natives. Under the new definition, the Eurasian group
was assigned to a social status that was between the Europeans at the top
and the remaining Asian masses. The term was regarded as derogatory in
India and was rejected flatly. However, it gained currency in the Far East
and Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Malaya.</p>

<p><strong>English Surnames</strong>
</p>
<p>In Britain, hereditary surnames were introduced by the Norman barons after
their conquest of Britain in 1066 and the 1086 Domesday survey. However,
the practice spread slowly. Among the feudal nobility and gentry, hereditary
surnames were adopted at a much faster pace. One reason was because they
could be used to maintain their hereditary rights to the lands and titles
they held, a practice that the Normans had been following in France even
before they came to Britain.</p>
<p>As for the commoners, it was sufficient for them to refer to each other
by a personal name or nickname as their communities were still small. But
as the population increased, it gradually became necessary for the commoners
to include identifiers in their names to set themselves apart. The sources
for these identifiers were endless. They could come from the person’s trades,
physical attributes and place of origin thus leading to names such as John
the butcher, William the short or Henry from Sutton. It was also often
that patronymics, the using of the father’s given name as the child’s last
name, were used. For example, John, the son of William, would be John Williamson
or Williams.</p>
<p>The identifying names were not fixed and they were often changed or dropped
at will. For example, John the butcher may become John the carpenter after
switching trades. It was only in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII after
the enactment of the Registration Act requiring people to record a permanent
surname in Church registers for births, marriage and deaths that commoners
adopted fixed hereditary surnames. However, as standardised spelling for
both surnames and forenames did not arrive until the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
some surnames underwent some variations. For instance, Thacker, Thackery
and Thackwray are variation of Thatcher, a trade-related surname. In England
alone there are around 45,000 different surnames, each with a history behind
it.</p>

<p><strong>British Roots</strong>
</p>
<p>When the British began to make their presence felt in the region towards
the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, many of them started families in
India and the Malay Archipelago with local or Portuguese-descended women
thus giving rise to Eurasian families with British heritage (including
the Irish, Welsh and Scots). Among the earliest were the British-Eurasian
families originated in India and Ceylon as well as in Bencoolen. The offspring
of the British-Eurasians in Bencoolen were particularly noteworthy because
they represented the earliest Eurasian families in Singapore. Among those
were the names Leicester, Nicholson, Angus and Perreau. Some of the Singapore-Eurasian
family names such as Cornelius, Clarke, Shepherdson, and Oliveiro could
also trace their roots to the British colonies of Penang and Malacca, while
others like Trails to Burma, Siam and Indo-China. In terms of language
and culture, the British had the most influence on the Singapore-Eurasian
community. But most of all, the British were the ones that introduced the
term “Eurasian” in the 1820s to describe people of European-Asian mixed
blood. The term was also used to classify and position the progeny of European-Asian
intermarriages as British subjects that were in between the Europeans and
the Asian en masse. In India, the term Eurasian was rejected by the Anglo-Indians
outright but it gained traction in Southeast Asia and the Far East.</p>

<p><strong>Eurasians of other European Groups</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Surnames from other European Groups</strong>
</p>
<p>When it comes to tracing family history, one of the first sources to consult
is the registry for births, marriage and deaths. Not only the registry
provides vital information such as names, dates and places, it also allows
one to trace his or her lineage through surnames. However, it is important
to note that most European families, except the nobilities or land-owning
gentry, did not have fixed surnames until the use and registry of surnames
was introduced. Prior to then, people referred to each other by a personal
name or nicknames. As the population increased, they began to include names
in addition to their given names as identifiers.</p>
<p>One of the most common methods these identifying names were constructed
was through patronymics where a personal name was based on the name of
one's father. For example, John, the son of William, would be John Williamson
or Williams. In addition, identifying names could derive from various sources
such as occupation, physical attributes and the individual’s place of origin.
As a result, European names have prepositions. For instance, the Dutch
names have “van”, “van der”, or “de”, while the Portuguese have “da”, “das”
or “dos”.</p>
<p>With the advent of the registry of surnames, European families started
to use these identifying names as their hereditary surnames. As a result,
the process of tracing one’s surname is not as straightforward as one can
imagine. In fact, as the individual goes back in time, he or she will discover
the rich history behind it.</p>

<p>Besides the Portuguese, Dutch and British, the Singapore-Eurasian community
could also trace their heritage to the other European groups such as the
French, German, Spanish and Danish that had either established colonies
or had commercial interests in the Far East region. Some of the them, particularly
the Germans, arrived at the Far East as soldiers employed by the Dutch.
Stationing in places such as Malacca, the Germans assimilated with the
Dutch and Dutch-Eurasian community. This trend was also repeated in the
British colonies in the East and the British Straits Settlements.</p>

<p>The Germans moved to Penang in the Straits Settlements, drawn by business
opportunities as entrepreneurs or as part of larger conglomerates. Their
life and contributions are examined with accompanying photographs and illustrations
until the difficult period of World War II. Chapters on German writers
resident in Penang, a profile of Charles Ernest Tardy the patriarch of
the Eurasian Karl family and the German trade expand on individuals involved
in the community. A useful bibliography is appended.</p>

<p>Since Singapore’s founding in 1819, missionaries, merchants, planters
and other French pioneers have come to the fledgling island port and contributed
to its economic, educational and cultural development. This book documents
the legacy of the French community and their contributions in Singapore.
Various personalities featured include J. Casteleyns (who built the first
hostelry in 1857, the Hotel de l’Europe), Father Jean-Marie Beurel (who
constructed the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and St Joseph’s Institution
in 1839) and Alfred Clouët (who started the well-known Ayam Brand canned
sardines business).</p>

### **Conducting Family History Search on Singapore-Eurasians**

<p>In general, these resources are useful to delve into for family history
research on Singapore-Eurasians.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Births, deaths and marriages records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Church records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School records</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary resources such as books, biographies and articles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How these records are used by the featured families in their family history
research is largely dependent on their ethnic and religious background.
For instance, to trace vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage
dates of family members, a Eurasian family, which is of European descent
and often of Christian denomination, may start off with church records.</p>
<p>In addition, as one of the primary goals of family history research is
to trace their ancestors back to the country of origins, it is often that
such research would span beyond the borders of Singapore. For example,
since the Eurasians carry a pedigree of European and Asian, their origins
can be traced to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from Europe
as well as the various European settlements in the region such as Malacca,
Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao and Penang in the 19th century. The sources
from which European names are derived are almost endless. It could originate
from nicknames, physical attributes, counties, trades, heraldic charges
and almost every object known to mankind. So for a Eurasian to trace his
or her family tree, the person needs to look at all these possibilities
in order to recognise their ancestors.</p>
<p>To have a general idea on how to build a Eurasian family tree, the following
books from the National Library are a good start collection.</p>

### **Government Records and Business Directories**

<p>Apart from records that are related to births, marriages and deaths, names
can also be obtained from publications produced by the Straits Settlements
government given that the person had worked in the government. In these
publications, it is possible to find the person’s name, the government
department that he or she worked in, and in some cases the salary he or
she drew. Besides this, if your ancestors were merchants or businessmen,
there is a good chance that they would be listed in a business directory.
The earliest Singapore business directory was published in 1846 as Singapore
Almanack, Calendar and Directory and the title varies over the years. Below
are some of these publications in the library’s collection.</p>

### **Church Records and Directories**

<p><strong>Church Directory</strong>
</p>
<p>There are currently more than 500 churches of all Christian denomiation
in Singapore. To obtain the listing of all these churches, users can consult
the church directory compiled by the National Council of Churches of Singapore
listed below.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=12548044" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A guide to churches and Christian organisations in Singapore</a></em>.

<p>Alternatively, you can also visit the main websites of the various Christian
denominations and churches for more information on the respective churches
they are seeking. Some of the major ones are listed below:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Archdiocese of Singapore (Roman Catholic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diocese of Singapore (Anglican)</p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Roman Catholic Church Records</strong>
</p>
<p>Church records are another important source of information for genealogy
research. The main types of information you can get from these records
are baptism, marriage and death registrations. As Eurasians are mostly
Roman Catholics, they should be able to find information on their ancestors
in records from the different Roman Catholic churches in Singapore. These
records are currently housed in the National Archives of Singapore. The
Archives also has records of churches from other Christian denominations
including the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian. Some of the church
records, especially those from the earliest churches in Singapore which
were established in the 1800s and early 1900s, are listed below. Users
are able to search for more church records using the National Archives
of Singapore online catalogue (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nas.gov.sg/archivesonline</a>).</p>

### **Clubs and Associations Records**

<p><strong>The Eurasian Association</strong>
</p>
<p>The Eurasian Association was founded in 1919. Since then, the Association
had always been at the forefront of the Eurasian community in Singapore,
looking after their economic and social interests. Today, the mission of
the Association remains relatively unchanged. It continues to act as a
platform to enrich the cohesiveness of the Eurasian community as well as
to integrate the community into the larger multi-ethnic, multi-religious
and multi-cultural of the Singapore society.</p>
<p>Clubs and associations related to the Eurasian community continued to
be active in pre and post-independence Singapore. Among the three main
Eurasian clubs, two of them – the Singapore Recreation Club and the Girls’
Sports Club – underwent major changes including allowing the admission
of non-Eurasian members. Despite the liberalisation effort, these clubs
remained popular among the Eurasians. The overall experience on the changes
these clubs and associations underwent and its impact on the Eurasian community
during the pre and post-independence periods are captured in the publications
below.</p>

through records of trade and professional associations as well as other
secular social clubs and unions. Usually, these records consist of minutes
of council meetings and the annual general meetings, circulars, annual
reports and statements of accounts. But some of them have membership list
or membership applications thus proving to be important sources of names.

### **Ship Registers and Passenger Lists**

<p>Passenger lists are records of people travelling on a ship from one place
to another. Passenger lists usually offer important data such as the names
of passengers, place of embarkation, age and destination. As most Singaporeans
have ancestors who arrived here in the 1800s or later, these lists will
be helpful in tracing ancestors. Currently, passenger lists and ships registers
could be obtained from the resources below.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ships Registers and Passengers Lists</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Master Attendant’s Office Registry of British Ships and Ships Registers, 1866-1957</em></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This series is currently located at the National Archives of Singapore.
It consists of a wide range of subjects covering the registry of British
ships, register of British and foreign ships, Master Attendant’s Colony
Account Book, etc. Contents such as ships’ particulars and particulars
of ship owners are useful records for genealogy research as it provides
the arrival dates of ships that stopped in Singapore. However, the records
do not contain the passenger list. The list can only be found in newspapers.</p>
<p>Available in microfilm at National Archives of Singapore</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser, 1835-1942</em></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The<em> Singapore Free Press &amp; Mercantile Advertiser</em> was a four-page
weekly, with a page of commercial and shipping news that catered to the
colony's burgeoning commercial enterprise. Backed by private merchants
and lawyers, it earned a reputation of being a reliable, sober and moderate
journal. One of the most important information held in this newspapers
is the ship passenger arrival lists. Search on the newspaper can be conducted
via the library's <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a> online database.</p>
<p></p>
<strong>Newspapers</strong>
<p><strong>Eurasian Newspapers</strong>
</p>
<p>In an effort to develop a distinct Eurasian identity, the Eurasian community
in Singapore began exploring ways to consolidate its communal bond. Other
than forming clubs and associations, the Eurasians also started publishing
their own newspapers to develop a voice for the community. Below are the
key Eurasian newspapers that were published towards the end of the 19th
century. These newspapers carry mostly advertisements of companies owned
by Eurasians. They also feature opinion pieces written by Eurasians. Users
can access these newspapers via our <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG </a>online
database.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p><em>Straits Eurasian Advocate</em> (1888)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Daily Advertiser</em> (1890-1894)</p>

<p><em>Mid-day Herald</em> (1895-1896)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Straits Telegraph and Daily Advertiser</em> (1899)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Newspapers are an important source of information for research on 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> century Singapore, and can be good source of information
for genealogy. The types of information you can find in newspapers are:</p>
<p><u>Marriage notices</u>
</p>
<p>Marriage notices contain the names of the bride and groom and the wedding
date. They may also include names of other relatives and guests who attended
the wedding and other information.</p>
<p><u>Obituaries</u>
</p>
<p>Obituaries are articles that announce an individual’s death. They give
vital particulars of the decreased such as names, age, birth and death,
funeral date, native place names and names of next-of-kins.</p>
<p><u>Other Information</u>
</p>
<p>Apart from passenger lists and marriage and death notices, other public
notices in the newspapers such as government notices as well as news articles
can also offer unique information about individuals.</p>
<p>The National Reference Library has a collection of Singapore newspapers
dating from the early 1800s. Below is a listing of the major English newspapers
available at the National Library.</p>

### **Eurasians during the Japanese Occupation**

<p>The Japanese occupation of Singapore lasted about forty-four months. During
this period as well as the months leading up to the invasion and eventual
fall of Singapore, the Eurasian community together with other ethnic groups
underwent an unnerving wartime experience with the constant fear of internment,
torture and even death. Within the Eurasian community, those from the “D”
and “G” Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps and the Singapore Royal
Artillery were among the first to experience war. As the war intensified
and the Japanese forces moving southwards towards Singapore after landing
at Kota Bahru on 8 December 1941, the Singapore Volunteer Corps were mobilised
to take part in the defence of Malaya and Singapore. When Singapore fell
on 15 February 1942, the volunteer corps, including Eurasian volunteers,
was last stationed at Goodwood Park Hotel. By then, many Eurasian volunteers
had lost their lives in battle. Many others would succumbed to hunger,
sickness and brutality when they were interned as prisoners of war at Changi
prison or deported to Thailand to lay the “Death Railway”, the railway
line to link peninsular Malaysia and Burma.</p>
<p>The violence and horrors of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore
were not confined to the battlegrounds. Right from the start when the Japanese
began their invasion in Malaya, countless air raids were carried out by
the Japanese on Singapore which inflicted huge loss of civilian lives.
After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese continued to terrorise the civilian
population as they tried to weed out anti-Japanese elements within the
different ethnic communities in Malaya and Singapore. Because of their
European descent, the Japanese thought it was likely that British sympathisers
would exist within the Eurasian community. In order to keep the Eurasians
in check, the Japanese ordered the appointment of a Eurasian committee.
The new committee comprised leading Eurasians like G.E.N Oehlers, H.E.
Woodford, W.H. Mosbergen and G. Shelley, and it was tasked by the Japanese
to determine the number and particulars of Eurasians residing in Singapore.
Subsequently, the entire Singapore-Eurasian community was ordered by the
Japanese to assemble on the Padang for mass screening. During the screening,
Eurasians who were suspected of involvement in the defence of Malaya and
Singapore were detained. Some of them were reported to be executed. Others
who were employed in essential services such as the electrical and water
departments were ordered to return to their posts. For the rest of the
community, they were commanded to return to the livelihood, switch their
allegiance to the Japanese government and not to take part in anti-Japanese
activities. The Eurasian Association was renamed the Syonan Eurasian Welfare
Association (SEWA) and Dr Charles J. P. Paglar was appointed by the Japanese
as the President of SEWA with John Bertram van Cuylenburg as the Vice President.</p>
<p>However, not all Japanese officers were notorious. There were some who
were sympathetic and took an interest in the welfare of the different communities
in Singapore. Mamoru Shonzaki was one such notable who worked with a number
of Eurasians including Dr Paglar to look after the Eurasian community in
Singapore and in the Bahau settlement in Negri Sembilan. Bahau was a village
created by the Japanese for the Eurasians to imitate the Endau Chinese
settlement in Johor. Both settlements were part of the larger Japanese
attempt to create a string of self-sufficient agricultural settlements
to allay the food shortage problem in Singapore. While the Endau was relatively
successful, Bahau punctuated with problems including diseases and poor
soil and living conditions. As a result, many Eurasians perished in Bahau.
Many more would have similar fate if not for the medical care provided
by Dr Paglar and other Eurasian doctors like Dr Jock Oehlers and Dr Cuylenburg.</p>
<p>This section provides a list of books and resources that contain general
accounts of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore as well as the
Japanese occupation of Singapore. The topics these resources discuss include
the disastrous British defence of Malaya and Singapore, the disorganised
evacuation of civilians from Singapore and Singapore under the Japanese.

<p><strong>Singapore Volunteer Corps</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Volunteer Corps began as the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps
in 1854, with the support of the Governor, Colonel J. Butterworth. The
outbreak of riots between Chinese secret societies in 1854 led to the formation
of a volunteer force to booster the internal security of Singapore. The
group underwent several reorganisations and was known by various names
through its history. In 1965, it was renamed the People's Defence Force.
The Eurasians had a company in the Corps. The company was formed in 1901
before it was disbanded in 1909. It was then formed again in 1918. This
contingent would take part in the defence of Singapore against the Japanese
in 1942 as the "D" Company.</p>

<p>The Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore including the British response
is a well researched area, resulting in the production of many resources.
The selected resources below cover many topics such as the reasons behind
the Japanese invasion, the British defence strategy in Malaya and Singapore,
the battle of Singapore and the final days before the British surrendered.
For family history research, grasping a general understanding of the Japanese
invasion and occupation of Malaya and Singapore is only a part of the research
process. To obtain better insights on the wartime experience of the different
communities in Singapore, one could delve deeper into the memories collected
by families. Such accounts could be acquired through biographies or autobiographies.
From these publications, the reader could find names and accounts of soldiers
or volunteers including those from the Eurasian community who had fought
in Malaya and Singapore as well as names of families who were evacuated
days before the fall of Singapore. This is in addition to the many first-person
accounts of life during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

<p>Similar to the other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Eurasian community
had a difficult time during the Japanese Occupation. Almost immediately
after the British surrendered, the entire community was summoned by the
Japanese to undergo mass screening. During the screening, many Eurasians
who were suspected to have taken part in the defence of Malaya and Singapore
were arrested. As for the rest, they were ordered back to return to their
livelihood but under the constant surveillance of the Japanese secret police
or the Kempeitai. In 1943, the Japanese decided to set up an agricultural
settlement for the Eurasians in Bahau in order to ease the food shortage
problem in Singapore. From December 1943 to April 1944, some 2,000 Eurasians
left Singapore for Bahau. However, most of the settlers had little knowledge
of farming and found life tough at Bahau. Many suffered from malnutrition,
as they were unable to make themselves more self-sufficient in food. In
addition, they were plagued by malaria and other diseases. It was estimated
that some 500 people lost their lives there, including their leader Bishop
Devals. The wartime experience of the Eurasians in Singapore and Bahau
can be found in the autobiographies and biographies below. They are authored
by Eurasians as well as those who had interacted with the Eurasian community
during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

<p><strong>Bahau Settlement</strong>
</p>
<p>Bahau Settlement was an agricultural settlement set up at Bahau in the
Malayan state of Negri Sembilan during the Japanese Occupation. The settlement
was set up under a self-sufficiency scheme initiated by the Japanese authorities
to ease the food supply problem in Singapore. Under the scheme, Singaporeans
were encouraged to resettle outside Singapore, in areas where they could
farm and live off the land. The Bahau Settlement was specially set up for
Eurasians and Chinese Roman Catholics. It was also known as <em>Fuji-go</em>,
which means "Fuji village". Below are some resources that covered this

### **Eurasians in Pre- and Post-Independence Singapore**

<p>The Japanese surrendered to the Allied Forces on 15 August 1945 effectively
ending the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. A month later, the British
returned to Singapore amid a scene of joy and jubilance. This euphoria,
however, was short-lived as it was soon overtaken by the reality of reconstructing
a post-war Singapore. Some of the immediate problems that the British faced
included a thriving black market, a disoriented public service, food shortages
and deteriorating infrastructure. They also had to address a rising nationalistic
sentiment and the communist threat. To tackle these problems, the British
started relooking the way they governed Singapore. Instead of bringing
back the administration structure that was in place from 1819 to 1942,
the British implemented reforms that would ultimately prepare Singapore
for self-government. Notable changes were made in the areas of education,
public services and legislature where a sense of belonging and nation-building
were instilled. Local officers were also appointed or elected to fill up
the positions in these areas.</p>
<p>With their head start in education and fluency in the English language,
the Eurasians were among the first local community that the British drew
upon to indigenise the civil service. They were also sought after as members
of Singapore’s first political parties such as the Progressive Party, the
Democratic Party, the Labour Party and the People’s Action Party. This
trend continued well into the 1950s and by the time Singapore attained
self-government in 1959, there were a number of Eurasians serving in the
government. They included Singapore’s first Speaker of Parliament Sir George
Edward Noel Oehlers, first head civil service George Edwin Bogaars, the
first chairman of Port of Authority of Singapore Stanley Toft Stewart,
the first local commissioner of police John Le Cain, and Law Minister Edmund
William Barker who was also involved in the crafting of the Proclamation
of Singapore hours before Singapore announced its separation from Malaysia
on 9 August 1965. After achieving independence, more Eurasians including
those aforementioned continued to serve the government taking on roles
in agencies such as the Economic Development Board and the Singapore Tourism
Board. For instance, Kenneth Michael Bryne was a top civil servant having
held many senior positions in the government including chairman of the
Singapore Tourism Board and the Central Provident Fund as well as High
Commissioner of several countries. Herman Ronald Hochstadt was another
top civil servant having served as Deputy Secretary at the Treasury, Permanent
Secretary at the Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Education,
Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Chairman
of the Mass Rapid Transit Authority board. Hedwig Anuar, on the other hand,
served as the director of the National Library from 1964 to 1988.</p>
<p>Besides the government, many Eurasians also made their mark in the professional
field in areas such as medicine, research, education, and arts and culture.
For example, Ernest Steven Monteiro, who was pro-chancellor of the National
University of Singapore, is remembered for his contributions these areas,
while Maureen Clarke was well known for her talent in amateur dramatics.
Perhaps one of the most prominent Eurasian who excelled in the professional
field was Dr Benjamin Henry Shears. Not only he was one of the first locals
to be appointed as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University
of Malaya in Singapore in the 1950s, Shears was also a founding member
of the Academy of Medicine and had contributed significantly to the field
of medical research. In 1971, Shears was awarded the highest honour in
Singapore when he was appointed the second President of the Republic of
Singapore. He held this position for a decade from 1971 to 1981.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the Eurasian community, the period from the end of
the Japanese Occupation to the late 1980s was dedicated mostly to rebuilding
the Eurasian community bond. After the war, the Eurasians were divided
in reactions to the political developments in Singapore as the colony strived
towards nationhood. Those who chose to remain loyal to the British opted
to leave Singapore for Britain and other Commonwealth countries. For the
remaining group who did not emigrate, they remained in Singapore to become
Singaporeans eventually. Despite staying on, the Eurasians in Singapore
experienced a decline in their communal identity in the 1970s. Partly,
this was due to the rise of a non-communal outlook among the Eurasians
as they tried to assimilate with other Singaporeans of different ethnic
groups. The decline was also attributed to a sense of displacement. After
Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, the multi-ethnic presentation
of the nation did not include Eurasians as one of the major cultures. Instead,
their identity was hidden under the “others” ethnic category which includes
the smaller ethnic communities such as the Jews and the Armenians. The
decline in the Eurasian identity was evident in terms of membership figures
of the Eurasian Association. After reaching a peak of 855 members in 1973,
the Association’s membership began to dwindle falling to as low as 91 in
1986. Amid the development within the Eurasian community, the community
continued to produce prominent figures such as sportsmen and literary figures
who contributed greatly to the nation-building process.</p>
<p>To reverse the downward trend in the Eurasian identity, the Management
Committee of the Eurasian Association decided to embark on a massive membership
drive in 1989, a year which became known as the year of Eurasian Awakening.
Led by a group of younger Eurasians and driven by the determination to
rekindle the sense of belonging within the Eurasian community, the Management
Committee drove the Eurasian Association membership up to almost 1,000
in less than two years through the introduction of programmes and activities
that encourage community bonding. The Eurasian Association’s effort to
uplift the Eurasian community was given a boost in 1994 when it was accorded
by the Government Self-Help status to act on behalf of the Eurasian community
in Singapore.</p>

### **Publications on Eurasians**

<p></p>
<p><strong>Books on the Eurasians</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Capturing the Eurasian Culture</strong>
</p>
<p>During the post-independence period, the Eurasian community had produced
many publications to highlight their identity. These publications vary
from general works on the community to biographies or autobiographies.
There are also novels and even cookbooks to highlight the culture of the
Eurasians. For family history research, these publications are able to
provide the researchers an understanding to the social and cultural background
of the Eurasians. They are also useful in terms of linking the researchers
to other related sources.</p>

<p>The Eurasian community produced many publications pertaining to their
family history. The coverage of these publications usually spanned from
the colonial to the present period covering major historical events in
Singapore. Some of them even went as far back as the pre-colonial period
to provide a narrative of the origins of the Singapore-Eurasian community.
These publications provide valuable information for Eurasians to trace
their ancestors as many of them contain family trees and names of Eurasian
families as well as their cultural heritage. The following titles are some
of these publications.</p>
