<h3><strong>Introduction - The Eurasian Community in Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>Eurasians are one of Singapore’s four major ethnic groups. Carrying a
pedigree of European and Asian, the Eurasians are also Singapore’s earliest
ethnic communities. The origins of the Eurasians in Singapore can be traced
to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from the various European
settlements in the region such as Malacca, Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao
and Penang in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Of significance were the Portuguese,
Dutch and British. But it also included the European ancestries of Danish,
French, German, Italian and Spanish though to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The first Eurasians arrived in Singapore shortly after Sir Stamford Raffles
landed on the island in 1819. Similar to other ethnic groups, the Eurasians
of early Singapore lived in communal enclaves. One of the earliest known
Eurasian enclaves was situated in the Waterloo area, along the three roads
of Waterloo Street, Queen Street and Bencoolen Street running parallel
to each other. The houses in the area varied from bungalows to terrace
houses and from shophouses to two-storey homes. As the early Singapore-Eurasians
were Christians, it was no surprise to find them attending churches and
schools in the area. Some of the most notably churches and schools in the
Waterloo area included the Church of Saint Peter and Paul, Saint Joseph
Church, Cathedral of Good Shepherd, and Saint Joseph Institution. As the
Singapore-Eurasian community expanded, they began to fan out to other residential
areas such as Serangoon, Haig Road, Bukit Timah and Katong.</p>
<p>A distinct Singapore-Eurasian identity began to emerge towards the end
of the 1800s when the Eurasians began forming associations to consolidate
themselves and to look after the interests of their community. From the
1880s to the start of the Second World War, there were four main organisations
to which Eurasians affiliated themselves. These were the Singapore Recreation
Club (1883), the Eurasian Association (1919), the Girls’ Sports Club (1929)
and the Eurasian Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps. In addition,
the Eurasian community also established a number of newspapers since the
1870s as a means to voice their sentiments. Some of these newspapers included
the Straits Intelligence, the Singapore Eurasian Advocate, the Daily Advertiser
(later renamed the Phoenix Press), and the Midday Herald (later renamed
the Straits Telegraph).</p>
<p>Apart from associations and organisations, the Singapore-Eurasian community
also derived some of their cultural identity and sense of community from
the rituals and customs they followed. For Eurasians who are Christians,
the most important festivals are naturally Christmas and Easter. For other
Eurasians who have different faith, they would follow the celebrations
of that particular faith. As with any other community groups the Singapore-Eurasian
community also has their own culture that cuts across areas ranging from
costumes to food.</p>
<p>Due to their fluency in the English language and their European heritage,
the common places of employment for the Eurasians were mainly in the civil
service and the municipality taking on jobs in government departments such
as the Department of Education, Registry of Vehicles, the Police Force
or the Government Monopolies Department (Customs department). Many Eurasians
also served as engineers with the Keppel Harbour Docks and the Singapore
Slipway, while others entered journalism, broadcasting or the private sector
joining established banks and companies such as Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank, Shell Company, Dunlop, Boustead and Adamson Gilfillan. Besides these
professional positions, many Eurasians who obtained education through government
scholarship or family support were among the first lawyers, doctors and
university lecturers in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>Similar to other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Singapore-Eurasian
community produced prominent figures and leaders who contributed in major
ways to their own community and Singapore in general. During the colonial
period, Eurasian leaders such as Edwin John Tessensohn, Noel Leicester
Clarke, Claude Henry da Silva and Percival Frank Aroozoo were instrumental
in strengthening the communal bond and welfare among Eurasians either through
various community works or by representing them in the Legislative Council
or the Straits Settlements Association, while others like Charles Joseph
Pemberton Palgar led the Eurasian community through the Japanese Occupation
and tended to the inhabitants of the failing Eurasian community at Bahau.
Many prominent Eurasians were involved in Singapore’s struggle for independence
as well as the crucial years after independence. Some of them who had taken
key roles in the government and civil service included Edward William Barker,
George Edwin Bogaars, Hedwig Anuar and Dr. Benjamin Henry Shears.</p>
<p>The post-independence era also saw the Eurasians rebuilt their community
bond slowly. In the late 1950s, women were granted membership to the Eurasian
Association and Youth groups were formed to encourage community bonding
through sports and cultural exchanges. However it was only after 1989 that
the Eurasians took on more sustainable efforts through the Eurasian Association
to rekindle the sense of belonging shared among the Eurasians, especially
the younger generation. In fact, 1989 for the Eurasian Association was
known as the year of the Eurasian Awakening as a younger group of Eurasians
decided to take the lead to uplift the community. It was a turning point
as membership of Eurasian Association began to increase, and more elaborate
community bonding programmes and activities were introduced. Furthermore,
it also generated research interest among some Eurasians to trace the community
or their own Eurasian heritage.</p>
<p>To understand the Singapore-Eurasian community and its heritage, this
resource guide lists out the relevant resources and materials that are
found within the collections of the National Library and the National Archives
of Singapore. It also identifies some authoritative resources that can
be found in the web.</p>

<h3><strong>Conducting Family History Search on Singapore-Eurasians</strong></h3>
<p>In general, these resources are useful to delve into for family history
research on Singapore-Eurasians.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Births, deaths and marriages records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Church records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clubs and association records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immigration and shipping records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land records and maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newspapers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary resources such as books, biographies and articles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How these records are used by the featured families in their family history
research is largely dependent on their ethnic and religious background.
For instance, to trace vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage
dates of family members, a Eurasian family, which is of European descent
and often of Christian denomination, may start off with church records.</p>
<p>In addition, as one of the primary goals of family history research is
to trace their ancestors back to the country of origins, it is often that
such research would span beyond the borders of Singapore. For example,
since the Eurasians carry a pedigree of European and Asian, their origins
can be traced to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from Europe
as well as the various European settlements in the region such as Malacca,
Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao and Penang in the 19th century. The sources
from which European names are derived are almost endless. It could originate
from nicknames, physical attributes, counties, trades, heraldic charges
and almost every object known to mankind. So for a Eurasian to trace his
or her family tree, the person needs to look at all these possibilities
in order to recognise their ancestors.</p>
<p>To have a general idea on how to build a Eurasian family tree, the following
books from the National Library are a good start collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Government Records and Business Directories</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from records that are related to births, marriages and deaths, names
can also be obtained from publications produced by the Straits Settlements
government given that the person had worked in the government. In these
publications, it is possible to find the person’s name, the government
department that he or she worked in, and in some cases the salary he or
she drew. Besides this, if your ancestors were merchants or businessmen,
there is a good chance that they would be listed in a business directory.
The earliest Singapore business directory was published in 1846 as Singapore
Almanack, Calendar and Directory and the title varies over the years. Below
are some of these publications in the library’s collection.</p>

they are seeking. Some of the major ones are listed below:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Archdiocese of Singapore (Roman Catholic)</u></em>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Diocese of Singapore (Anglican)</u></em>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Roman Catholic Church Records</strong>
</p>
<p>Church records are another important source of information for genealogy
research. The main types of information you can get from these records
are baptism, marriage and death registrations. As Eurasians are mostly
Roman Catholics, they should be able to find information on their ancestors
in records from the different Roman Catholic churches in Singapore. These
records are currently housed in the National Archives of Singapore. The
Archives also has records of churches from other Christian denominations
including the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian. Some of the church
records, especially those from the earliest churches in Singapore which
were established in the 1800s and early 1900s, are listed below. Users
are able to search for more church records using the National Archives
of Singapore online catalogue (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nas.gov.sg/archivesonline</a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Clubs and Associations Records</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Eurasian Association</strong>
</p>
<p>The Eurasian Association was founded in 1919. Since then, the Association
had always been at the forefront of the Eurasian community in Singapore,
looking after their economic and social interests. Today, the mission of
the Association remains relatively unchanged. It continues to act as a
platform to enrich the cohesiveness of the Eurasian community as well as
to integrate the community into the larger multi-ethnic, multi-religious
and multi-cultural of the Singapore society.</p>
<p>Clubs and associations related to the Eurasian community continued to
be active in pre and post-independence Singapore. Among the three main
Eurasian clubs, two of them – the Singapore Recreation Club and the Girls’
Sports Club – underwent major changes including allowing the admission
of non-Eurasian members. Despite the liberalisation effort, these clubs
remained popular among the Eurasians. The overall experience on the changes
these clubs and associations underwent and its impact on the Eurasian community
during the pre and post-independence periods are captured in the publications
below.</p>

<p><strong>Professional Clubs and Associations</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides using the types of record above, it is also possible to find names
through records of trade and professional associations as well as other
secular social clubs and unions. Usually, these records consist of minutes
of council meetings and the annual general meetings, circulars, annual
reports and statements of accounts. But some of them have membership list
or membership applications thus proving to be important sources of names.
Below are some associations and organisations that Eurasians may be associated

<h3><strong>Ship Registers and Passenger Lists</strong></h3>
<p>Passenger lists are records of people travelling on a ship from one place
to another. Passenger lists usually offer important data such as the names
of passengers, place of embarkation, age and destination. As most Singaporeans
have ancestors who arrived here in the 1800s or later, these lists will
be helpful in tracing ancestors. Currently, passenger lists and ships registers
could be obtained from the resources below.</p>

Account Book, etc. Contents such as ships’ particulars and particulars
of ship owners are useful records for genealogy research as it provides
the arrival dates of ships that stopped in Singapore. However, the records
do not contain the passenger list. The list can only be found in newspapers.</p>

<p><strong>Eurasian Newspapers</strong>
</p>
<p>In an effort to develop a distinct Eurasian identity, the Eurasian community
in Singapore began exploring ways to consolidate its communal bond. Other
than forming clubs and associations, the Eurasians also started publishing
their own newspapers to develop a voice for the community. Below are the
key Eurasian newspapers that were published towards the end of the 19th
century. These newspapers carry mostly advertisements of companies owned
by Eurasians. They also feature opinion pieces written by Eurasians. Users
can access these newspapers via our <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG </a>online

<p>Newspapers are an important source of information for research on 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> century Singapore, and can be good source of information
for genealogy. The types of information you can find in newspapers are:</p>
<p><u>Marriage notices</u>
</p>
<p>Marriage notices contain the names of the bride and groom and the wedding
date. They may also include names of other relatives and guests who attended
the wedding and other information.</p>
<p><u>Obituaries</u>
</p>
<p>Obituaries are articles that announce an individual’s death. They give
vital particulars of the decreased such as names, age, birth and death,
funeral date, native place names and names of next-of-kins.</p>
<p><u>Other Information</u>
</p>
<p>Apart from passenger lists and marriage and death notices, other public
notices in the newspapers such as government notices as well as news articles
can also offer unique information about individuals.</p>

<h3><strong>Eurasians during the Japanese Occupation</strong></h3>
<p>The Japanese occupation of Singapore lasted about forty-four months. During
this period as well as the months leading up to the invasion and eventual
fall of Singapore, the Eurasian community together with other ethnic groups
underwent an unnerving wartime experience with the constant fear of internment,
torture and even death. Within the Eurasian community, those from the “D”
and “G” Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps and the Singapore Royal
Artillery were among the first to experience war. As the war intensified
and the Japanese forces moving southwards towards Singapore after landing
at Kota Bahru on 8 December 1941, the Singapore Volunteer Corps were mobilised
to take part in the defence of Malaya and Singapore. When Singapore fell
on 15 February 1942, the volunteer corps, including Eurasian volunteers,
was last stationed at Goodwood Park Hotel. By then, many Eurasian volunteers
had lost their lives in battle. Many others would succumbed to hunger,
sickness and brutality when they were interned as prisoners of war at Changi
prison or deported to Thailand to lay the “Death Railway”, the railway
line to link peninsular Malaysia and Burma.</p>
<p>The violence and horrors of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore
were not confined to the battlegrounds. Right from the start when the Japanese
began their invasion in Malaya, countless air raids were carried out by
the Japanese on Singapore which inflicted huge loss of civilian lives.
After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese continued to terrorise the civilian
population as they tried to weed out anti-Japanese elements within the
different ethnic communities in Malaya and Singapore. Because of their
European descent, the Japanese thought it was likely that British sympathisers
would exist within the Eurasian community. In order to keep the Eurasians
in check, the Japanese ordered the appointment of a Eurasian committee.
The new committee comprised leading Eurasians like G.E.N Oehlers, H.E.
Woodford, W.H. Mosbergen and G. Shelley, and it was tasked by the Japanese
to determine the number and particulars of Eurasians residing in Singapore.
Subsequently, the entire Singapore-Eurasian community was ordered by the
Japanese to assemble on the Padang for mass screening. During the screening,
Eurasians who were suspected of involvement in the defence of Malaya and
Singapore were detained. Some of them were reported to be executed. Others
who were employed in essential services such as the electrical and water
departments were ordered to return to their posts. For the rest of the
community, they were commanded to return to the livelihood, switch their
allegiance to the Japanese government and not to take part in anti-Japanese
activities. The Eurasian Association was renamed the Syonan Eurasian Welfare
Association (SEWA) and Dr Charles J. P. Paglar was appointed by the Japanese
as the President of SEWA with John Bertram van Cuylenburg as the Vice President.</p>
<p>However, not all Japanese officers were notorious. There were some who
were sympathetic and took an interest in the welfare of the different communities
in Singapore. Mamoru Shonzaki was one such notable who worked with a number
of Eurasians including Dr Paglar to look after the Eurasian community in
Singapore and in the Bahau settlement in Negri Sembilan. Bahau was a village
created by the Japanese for the Eurasians to imitate the Endau Chinese
settlement in Johor. Both settlements were part of the larger Japanese
attempt to create a string of self-sufficient agricultural settlements
to allay the food shortage problem in Singapore. While the Endau was relatively
successful, Bahau punctuated with problems including diseases and poor
soil and living conditions. As a result, many Eurasians perished in Bahau.
Many more would have similar fate if not for the medical care provided
by Dr Paglar and other Eurasian doctors like Dr Jock Oehlers and Dr Cuylenburg.</p>
<p>This section provides a list of books and resources that contain general
accounts of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore as well as the
Japanese occupation of Singapore. The topics these resources discuss include
the disastrous British defence of Malaya and Singapore, the disorganised
evacuation of civilians from Singapore and Singapore under the Japanese.

<p>The Singapore Volunteer Corps began as the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps
in 1854, with the support of the Governor, Colonel J. Butterworth. The
outbreak of riots between Chinese secret societies in 1854 led to the formation
of a volunteer force to booster the internal security of Singapore. The
group underwent several reorganisations and was known by various names
through its history. In 1965, it was renamed the People's Defence Force.
The Eurasians had a company in the Corps. The company was formed in 1901
before it was disbanded in 1909. It was then formed again in 1918. This
contingent would take part in the defence of Singapore against the Japanese
in 1942 as the "D" Company.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>The Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore including the British response
is a well researched area, resulting in the production of many resources.
The selected resources below cover many topics such as the reasons behind
the Japanese invasion, the British defence strategy in Malaya and Singapore,
the battle of Singapore and the final days before the British surrendered.
For family history research, grasping a general understanding of the Japanese
invasion and occupation of Malaya and Singapore is only a part of the research
process. To obtain better insights on the wartime experience of the different
communities in Singapore, one could delve deeper into the memories collected
by families. Such accounts could be acquired through biographies or autobiographies.
From these publications, the reader could find names and accounts of soldiers
or volunteers including those from the Eurasian community who had fought
in Malaya and Singapore as well as names of families who were evacuated
days before the fall of Singapore. This is in addition to the many first-person
accounts of life during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

<p>Similar to the other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Eurasian community
had a difficult time during the Japanese Occupation. Almost immediately
after the British surrendered, the entire community was summoned by the
Japanese to undergo mass screening. During the screening, many Eurasians
who were suspected to have taken part in the defence of Malaya and Singapore
were arrested. As for the rest, they were ordered back to return to their
livelihood but under the constant surveillance of the Japanese secret police
or the Kempeitai. In 1943, the Japanese decided to set up an agricultural
settlement for the Eurasians in Bahau in order to ease the food shortage
problem in Singapore. From December 1943 to April 1944, some 2,000 Eurasians
left Singapore for Bahau. However, most of the settlers had little knowledge
of farming and found life tough at Bahau. Many suffered from malnutrition,
as they were unable to make themselves more self-sufficient in food. In
addition, they were plagued by malaria and other diseases. It was estimated
that some 500 people lost their lives there, including their leader Bishop
Devals. The wartime experience of the Eurasians in Singapore and Bahau
can be found in the autobiographies and biographies below. They are authored
by Eurasians as well as those who had interacted with the Eurasian community
during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

<p><strong>Bahau Settlement</strong>
</p>
<p>Bahau Settlement was an agricultural settlement set up at Bahau in the
Malayan state of Negri Sembilan during the Japanese Occupation. The settlement
was set up under a self-sufficiency scheme initiated by the Japanese authorities
to ease the food supply problem in Singapore. Under the scheme, Singaporeans
were encouraged to resettle outside Singapore, in areas where they could
farm and live off the land. The Bahau Settlement was specially set up for
Eurasians and Chinese Roman Catholics. It was also known as <em>Fuji-go</em>,
which means "Fuji village". Below are some resources that covered this
topic.</p>

<h3><strong>Eurasians in Pre- and Post-Independence Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>The Japanese surrendered to the Allied Forces on 15 August 1945 effectively
ending the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. A month later, the British
returned to Singapore amid a scene of joy and jubilance. This euphoria,
however, was short-lived as it was soon overtaken by the reality of reconstructing
a post-war Singapore. Some of the immediate problems that the British faced
included a thriving black market, a disoriented public service, food shortages
and deteriorating infrastructure. They also had to address a rising nationalistic
sentiment and the communist threat. To tackle these problems, the British
started relooking the way they governed Singapore. Instead of bringing
back the administration structure that was in place from 1819 to 1942,
the British implemented reforms that would ultimately prepare Singapore
for self-government. Notable changes were made in the areas of education,
public services and legislature where a sense of belonging and nation-building
were instilled. Local officers were also appointed or elected to fill up
the positions in these areas.</p>
<p>With their head start in education and fluency in the English language,
the Eurasians were among the first local community that the British drew
upon to indigenise the civil service. They were also sought after as members
of Singapore’s first political parties such as the Progressive Party, the
Democratic Party, the Labour Party and the People’s Action Party. This
trend continued well into the 1950s and by the time Singapore attained
self-government in 1959, there were a number of Eurasians serving in the
government. They included Singapore’s first Speaker of Parliament Sir George
Edward Noel Oehlers, first head civil service George Edwin Bogaars, the
first chairman of Port of Authority of Singapore Stanley Toft Stewart,
the first local commissioner of police John Le Cain, and Law Minister Edmund
William Barker who was also involved in the crafting of the Proclamation
of Singapore hours before Singapore announced its separation from Malaysia
on 9 August 1965. After achieving independence, more Eurasians including
those aforementioned continued to serve the government taking on roles
in agencies such as the Economic Development Board and the Singapore Tourism
Board. For instance, Kenneth Michael Bryne was a top civil servant having
held many senior positions in the government including chairman of the
Singapore Tourism Board and the Central Provident Fund as well as High
Commissioner of several countries. Herman Ronald Hochstadt was another
top civil servant having served as Deputy Secretary at the Treasury, Permanent
Secretary at the Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Education,
Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Chairman
of the Mass Rapid Transit Authority board. Hedwig Anuar, on the other hand,
served as the director of the National Library from 1964 to 1988.</p>
<p>Besides the government, many Eurasians also made their mark in the professional
field in areas such as medicine, research, education, and arts and culture.
For example, Ernest Steven Monteiro, who was pro-chancellor of the National
University of Singapore, is remembered for his contributions these areas,
while Maureen Clarke was well known for her talent in amateur dramatics.
Perhaps one of the most prominent Eurasian who excelled in the professional
field was Dr Benjamin Henry Shears. Not only he was one of the first locals
to be appointed as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University
of Malaya in Singapore in the 1950s, Shears was also a founding member
of the Academy of Medicine and had contributed significantly to the field
of medical research. In 1971, Shears was awarded the highest honour in
Singapore when he was appointed the second President of the Republic of
Singapore. He held this position for a decade from 1971 to 1981.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the Eurasian community, the period from the end of
the Japanese Occupation to the late 1980s was dedicated mostly to rebuilding
the Eurasian community bond. After the war, the Eurasians were divided
in reactions to the political developments in Singapore as the colony strived
towards nationhood. Those who chose to remain loyal to the British opted
to leave Singapore for Britain and other Commonwealth countries. For the
remaining group who did not emigrate, they remained in Singapore to become
Singaporeans eventually. Despite staying on, the Eurasians in Singapore
experienced a decline in their communal identity in the 1970s. Partly,
this was due to the rise of a non-communal outlook among the Eurasians
as they tried to assimilate with other Singaporeans of different ethnic
groups. The decline was also attributed to a sense of displacement. After
Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, the multi-ethnic presentation
of the nation did not include Eurasians as one of the major cultures. Instead,
their identity was hidden under the “others” ethnic category which includes
the smaller ethnic communities such as the Jews and the Armenians. The
decline in the Eurasian identity was evident in terms of membership figures
of the Eurasian Association. After reaching a peak of 855 members in 1973,
the Association’s membership began to dwindle falling to as low as 91 in
1986. Amid the development within the Eurasian community, the community
continued to produce prominent figures such as sportsmen and literary figures
who contributed greatly to the nation-building process.</p>
<p>To reverse the downward trend in the Eurasian identity, the Management
Committee of the Eurasian Association decided to embark on a massive membership
drive in 1989, a year which became known as the year of Eurasian Awakening.
Led by a group of younger Eurasians and driven by the determination to
rekindle the sense of belonging within the Eurasian community, the Management
Committee drove the Eurasian Association membership up to almost 1,000
in less than two years through the introduction of programmes and activities
that encourage community bonding. The Eurasian Association’s effort to
uplift the Eurasian community was given a boost in 1994 when it was accorded
by the Government Self-Help status to act on behalf of the Eurasian community
in Singapore.</p>

<p>During the post-independence period, the Eurasian community had produced
many publications to highlight their identity. These publications vary
from general works on the community to biographies or autobiographies.
There are also novels and even cookbooks to highlight the culture of the
Eurasians. For family history research, these publications are able to
provide the researchers an understanding to the social and cultural background
of the Eurasians. They are also useful in terms of linking the researchers

<p>The Eurasian community produced many publications pertaining to their
family history. The coverage of these publications usually spanned from
the colonial to the present period covering major historical events in
Singapore. Some of them even went as far back as the pre-colonial period
to provide a narrative of the origins of the Singapore-Eurasian community.
These publications provide valuable information for Eurasians to trace
their ancestors as many of them contain family trees and names of Eurasian
families as well as their cultural heritage. The following titles are some
of these publications.</p>
