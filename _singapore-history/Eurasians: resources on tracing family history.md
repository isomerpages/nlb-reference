<h3><strong>Introduction - The Eurasian Community in Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>Eurasians are one of Singapore’s four major ethnic groups. Carrying a
pedigree of European and Asian, the Eurasians are also Singapore’s earliest
ethnic communities. The origins of the Eurasians in Singapore can be traced
to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from the various European
settlements in the region such as Malacca, Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao
and Penang in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Of significance were the Portuguese,
Dutch and British. But it also included the European ancestries of Danish,
French, German, Italian and Spanish though to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The first Eurasians arrived in Singapore shortly after Sir Stamford Raffles
landed on the island in 1819. Similar to other ethnic groups, the Eurasians
of early Singapore lived in communal enclaves. One of the earliest known
Eurasian enclaves was situated in the Waterloo area, along the three roads
of Waterloo Street, Queen Street and Bencoolen Street running parallel
to each other. The houses in the area varied from bungalows to terrace
houses and from shophouses to two-storey homes. As the early Singapore-Eurasians
were Christians, it was no surprise to find them attending churches and
schools in the area. Some of the most notably churches and schools in the
Waterloo area included the Church of Saint Peter and Paul, Saint Joseph
Church, Cathedral of Good Shepherd, and Saint Joseph Institution. As the
Singapore-Eurasian community expanded, they began to fan out to other residential
areas such as Serangoon, Haig Road, Bukit Timah and Katong.</p>
<p>A distinct Singapore-Eurasian identity began to emerge towards the end
of the 1800s when the Eurasians began forming associations to consolidate
themselves and to look after the interests of their community. From the
1880s to the start of the Second World War, there were four main organisations
to which Eurasians affiliated themselves. These were the Singapore Recreation
Club (1883), the Eurasian Association (1919), the Girls’ Sports Club (1929)
and the Eurasian Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps. In addition,
the Eurasian community also established a number of newspapers since the
1870s as a means to voice their sentiments. Some of these newspapers included
the Straits Intelligence, the Singapore Eurasian Advocate, the Daily Advertiser
(later renamed the Phoenix Press), and the Midday Herald (later renamed
the Straits Telegraph).</p>
<p>Apart from associations and organisations, the Singapore-Eurasian community
also derived some of their cultural identity and sense of community from
the rituals and customs they followed. For Eurasians who are Christians,
the most important festivals are naturally Christmas and Easter. For other
Eurasians who have different faith, they would follow the celebrations
of that particular faith. As with any other community groups the Singapore-Eurasian
community also has their own culture that cuts across areas ranging from
costumes to food.</p>
<p>Due to their fluency in the English language and their European heritage,
the common places of employment for the Eurasians were mainly in the civil
service and the municipality taking on jobs in government departments such
as the Department of Education, Registry of Vehicles, the Police Force
or the Government Monopolies Department (Customs department). Many Eurasians
also served as engineers with the Keppel Harbour Docks and the Singapore
Slipway, while others entered journalism, broadcasting or the private sector
joining established banks and companies such as Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank, Shell Company, Dunlop, Boustead and Adamson Gilfillan. Besides these
professional positions, many Eurasians who obtained education through government
scholarship or family support were among the first lawyers, doctors and
university lecturers in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>Similar to other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Singapore-Eurasian
community produced prominent figures and leaders who contributed in major
ways to their own community and Singapore in general. During the colonial
period, Eurasian leaders such as Edwin John Tessensohn, Noel Leicester
Clarke, Claude Henry da Silva and Percival Frank Aroozoo were instrumental
in strengthening the communal bond and welfare among Eurasians either through
various community works or by representing them in the Legislative Council
or the Straits Settlements Association, while others like Charles Joseph
Pemberton Palgar led the Eurasian community through the Japanese Occupation
and tended to the inhabitants of the failing Eurasian community at Bahau.
Many prominent Eurasians were involved in Singapore’s struggle for independence
as well as the crucial years after independence. Some of them who had taken
key roles in the government and civil service included Edward William Barker,
George Edwin Bogaars, Hedwig Anuar and Dr. Benjamin Henry Shears.</p>
<p>The post-independence era also saw the Eurasians rebuilt their community
bond slowly. In the late 1950s, women were granted membership to the Eurasian
Association and Youth groups were formed to encourage community bonding
through sports and cultural exchanges. However it was only after 1989 that
the Eurasians took on more sustainable efforts through the Eurasian Association
to rekindle the sense of belonging shared among the Eurasians, especially
the younger generation. In fact, 1989 for the Eurasian Association was
known as the year of the Eurasian Awakening as a younger group of Eurasians
decided to take the lead to uplift the community. It was a turning point
as membership of Eurasian Association began to increase, and more elaborate
community bonding programmes and activities were introduced. Furthermore,
it also generated research interest among some Eurasians to trace the community
or their own Eurasian heritage.</p>
<p>To understand the Singapore-Eurasian community and its heritage, this
resource guide lists out the relevant resources and materials that are
found within the collections of the National Library and the National Archives
of Singapore. It also identifies some authoritative resources that can
be found in the web.</p>

<h3><strong>Conducting Family History Search on Singapore-Eurasians</strong></h3>
<p>In general, these resources are useful to delve into for family history
research on Singapore-Eurasians.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Births, deaths and marriages records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Church records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clubs and association records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immigration and shipping records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land records and maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newspapers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary resources such as books, biographies and articles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How these records are used by the featured families in their family history
research is largely dependent on their ethnic and religious background.
For instance, to trace vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage
dates of family members, a Eurasian family, which is of European descent
and often of Christian denomination, may start off with church records.</p>
<p>In addition, as one of the primary goals of family history research is
to trace their ancestors back to the country of origins, it is often that
such research would span beyond the borders of Singapore. For example,
since the Eurasians carry a pedigree of European and Asian, their origins
can be traced to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from Europe
as well as the various European settlements in the region such as Malacca,
Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao and Penang in the 19th century. The sources
from which European names are derived are almost endless. It could originate
from nicknames, physical attributes, counties, trades, heraldic charges
and almost every object known to mankind. So for a Eurasian to trace his
or her family tree, the person needs to look at all these possibilities
in order to recognise their ancestors.</p>
<p>To have a general idea on how to build a Eurasian family tree, the following
books from the National Library are a good start collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Government Records and Business Directories</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from records that are related to births, marriages and deaths, names
can also be obtained from publications produced by the Straits Settlements
government given that the person had worked in the government. In these
publications, it is possible to find the person’s name, the government
department that he or she worked in, and in some cases the salary he or
she drew. Besides this, if your ancestors were merchants or businessmen,
there is a good chance that they would be listed in a business directory.
The earliest Singapore business directory was published in 1846 as Singapore
Almanack, Calendar and Directory and the title varies over the years. Below
are some of these publications in the library’s collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Church Records and Directories</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Church Directory</strong>
</p>
<p>There are currently more than 500 churches of all Christian denomiation
in Singapore. To obtain the listing of all these churches, users can consult
the church directory compiled by the National Council of Churches of Singapore
listed below.</p>

<p>Alternatively, users can also visit the main websites of the various Christian
denominations and churches for more information on the respective churches
they are seeking. Some of the major ones are listed below:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Archdiocese of Singapore (Roman Catholic)</u></em>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Diocese of Singapore (Anglican)</u></em>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Lutheran Church in Singapore</u></em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Roman Catholic Church Records</strong>
</p>
<p>Church records are another important source of information for genealogy
research. The main types of information you can get from these records
are baptism, marriage and death registrations. As Eurasians are mostly
Roman Catholics, they should be able to find information on their ancestors
in records from the different Roman Catholic churches in Singapore. These
records are currently housed in the National Archives of Singapore. The
Archives also has records of churches from other Christian denominations
including the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian. Some of the church
records, especially those from the earliest churches in Singapore which
were established in the 1800s and early 1900s, are listed below. Users
are able to search for more church records using the National Archives
of Singapore online catalogue (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nas.gov.sg/archivesonline</a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Educational Records</strong></h3>
<p>Other than birth, marriage and death records, school records and yearbooks
are also a valuable source of material for genealogy research. Below are
some resources that can be found in the collections of the National Archives
of Singapore and the National Library. The schools covered in this section
are mostly English missionary or government schools that are located near
the first Eurasian enclave or Waterloo Street area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Admission and Attendance Registers and School Records, 1888-1985</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The series consists of admission and attendance registers and other school
records. The admission registers contain students’ particulars (e.g. sex,
date and place of birth, race, admission date, etc.). Attendance registers
contain almost similar information except they include records of daily
attendance, school fee paid, summary of students’ roll, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>Ship Registers and Passenger Lists</strong></h3>
<p>Passenger lists are records of people travelling on a ship from one place
to another. Passenger lists usually offer important data such as the names
of passengers, place of embarkation, age and destination. As most Singaporeans
have ancestors who arrived here in the 1800s or later, these lists will
be helpful in tracing ancestors. Currently, passenger lists and ships registers
could be obtained from the resources below.</p>

<p>The<em> Singapore Free Press &amp; Mercantile Advertiser</em> was a four-page
weekly, with a page of commercial and shipping news that catered to the
colony's burgeoning commercial enterprise. Backed by private merchants
and lawyers, it earned a reputation of being a reliable, sober and moderate
journal. One of the most important information held in this newspapers

<h3><strong>Newspaper</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Eurasian Newspapers</strong>
</p>
<p>In an effort to develop a distinct Eurasian identity, the Eurasian community
in Singapore began exploring ways to consolidate its communal bond. Other
than forming clubs and associations, the Eurasians also started publishing
their own newspapers to develop a voice for the community. Below are the
key Eurasian newspapers that were published towards the end of the 19th
century. These newspapers carry mostly advertisements of companies owned
by Eurasians. They also feature opinion pieces written by Eurasians. Users
can access these newspapers via our <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG </a>online

<p>Newspapers are an important source of information for research on 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> century Singapore, and can be good source of information
for genealogy. The types of information you can find in newspapers are:</p>
<p><u>Marriage notices</u>
</p>
<p>Marriage notices contain the names of the bride and groom and the wedding
date. They may also include names of other relatives and guests who attended
the wedding and other information.</p>
<p><u>Obituaries</u>
</p>
<p>Obituaries are articles that announce an individual’s death. They give
vital particulars of the decreased such as names, age, birth and death,
funeral date, native place names and names of next-of-kins.</p>
<p><u>Other Information</u>
</p>
<p>Apart from passenger lists and marriage and death notices, other public
notices in the newspapers such as government notices as well as news articles
can also offer unique information about individuals.</p>

<h3><strong>Eurasians during the Japanese Occupation</strong></h3>
<p>The Japanese occupation of Singapore lasted about forty-four months. During
this period as well as the months leading up to the invasion and eventual
fall of Singapore, the Eurasian community together with other ethnic groups
underwent an unnerving wartime experience with the constant fear of internment,
torture and even death. Within the Eurasian community, those from the “D”
and “G” Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps and the Singapore Royal
Artillery were among the first to experience war. As the war intensified
and the Japanese forces moving southwards towards Singapore after landing
at Kota Bahru on 8 December 1941, the Singapore Volunteer Corps were mobilised
to take part in the defence of Malaya and Singapore. When Singapore fell
on 15 February 1942, the volunteer corps, including Eurasian volunteers,
was last stationed at Goodwood Park Hotel. By then, many Eurasian volunteers
had lost their lives in battle. Many others would succumbed to hunger,
sickness and brutality when they were interned as prisoners of war at Changi
prison or deported to Thailand to lay the “Death Railway”, the railway
line to link peninsular Malaysia and Burma.</p>
<p>The violence and horrors of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore
were not confined to the battlegrounds. Right from the start when the Japanese
began their invasion in Malaya, countless air raids were carried out by
the Japanese on Singapore which inflicted huge loss of civilian lives.
After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese continued to terrorise the civilian
population as they tried to weed out anti-Japanese elements within the
different ethnic communities in Malaya and Singapore. Because of their
European descent, the Japanese thought it was likely that British sympathisers
would exist within the Eurasian community. In order to keep the Eurasians
in check, the Japanese ordered the appointment of a Eurasian committee.
The new committee comprised leading Eurasians like G.E.N Oehlers, H.E.
Woodford, W.H. Mosbergen and G. Shelley, and it was tasked by the Japanese
to determine the number and particulars of Eurasians residing in Singapore.
Subsequently, the entire Singapore-Eurasian community was ordered by the
Japanese to assemble on the Padang for mass screening. During the screening,
Eurasians who were suspected of involvement in the defence of Malaya and
Singapore were detained. Some of them were reported to be executed. Others
who were employed in essential services such as the electrical and water
departments were ordered to return to their posts. For the rest of the
community, they were commanded to return to the livelihood, switch their
allegiance to the Japanese government and not to take part in anti-Japanese
activities. The Eurasian Association was renamed the Syonan Eurasian Welfare
Association (SEWA) and Dr Charles J. P. Paglar was appointed by the Japanese
as the President of SEWA with John Bertram van Cuylenburg as the Vice President.</p>
<p>However, not all Japanese officers were notorious. There were some who
were sympathetic and took an interest in the welfare of the different communities
in Singapore. Mamoru Shonzaki was one such notable who worked with a number
of Eurasians including Dr Paglar to look after the Eurasian community in
Singapore and in the Bahau settlement in Negri Sembilan. Bahau was a village
created by the Japanese for the Eurasians to imitate the Endau Chinese
settlement in Johor. Both settlements were part of the larger Japanese
attempt to create a string of self-sufficient agricultural settlements
to allay the food shortage problem in Singapore. While the Endau was relatively
successful, Bahau punctuated with problems including diseases and poor
soil and living conditions. As a result, many Eurasians perished in Bahau.
Many more would have similar fate if not for the medical care provided
by Dr Paglar and other Eurasian doctors like Dr Jock Oehlers and Dr Cuylenburg.</p>
<p>This section provides a list of books and resources that contain general
accounts of the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore as well as the
Japanese occupation of Singapore. The topics these resources discuss include
the disastrous British defence of Malaya and Singapore, the disorganised
evacuation of civilians from Singapore and Singapore under the Japanese.
Some of the most widely used resources related to this topic are stated

<p><strong>Singapore Volunteer Corps</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Volunteer Corps began as the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps
in 1854, with the support of the Governor, Colonel J. Butterworth. The
outbreak of riots between Chinese secret societies in 1854 led to the formation
of a volunteer force to booster the internal security of Singapore. The
group underwent several reorganisations and was known by various names
through its history. In 1965, it was renamed the People's Defence Force.
The Eurasians had a company in the Corps. The company was formed in 1901
before it was disbanded in 1909. It was then formed again in 1918. This
contingent would take part in the defence of Singapore against the Japanese
in 1942 as the "D" Company.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>The Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore including the British response
is a well researched area, resulting in the production of many resources.
The selected resources below cover many topics such as the reasons behind
the Japanese invasion, the British defence strategy in Malaya and Singapore,
the battle of Singapore and the final days before the British surrendered.
For family history research, grasping a general understanding of the Japanese
invasion and occupation of Malaya and Singapore is only a part of the research
process. To obtain better insights on the wartime experience of the different
communities in Singapore, one could delve deeper into the memories collected
by families. Such accounts could be acquired through biographies or autobiographies.
From these publications, the reader could find names and accounts of soldiers
or volunteers including those from the Eurasian community who had fought
in Malaya and Singapore as well as names of families who were evacuated
days before the fall of Singapore. This is in addition to the many first-person
accounts of life during the Japanese Occupation.</p>
