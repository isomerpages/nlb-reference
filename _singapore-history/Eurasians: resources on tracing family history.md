<h3>Introduction - The Eurasian Community in Singapore</h3>
<p>Eurasians are one of Singapore’s four major ethnic groups. Carrying a
pedigree of European and Asian, the Eurasians are also Singapore’s earliest
ethnic communities. The origins of the Eurasians in Singapore can be traced
to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from the various European
settlements in the region such as Malacca, Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao
and Penang in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Of significance were the Portuguese,
Dutch and British. But it also included the European ancestries of Danish,
French, German, Italian and Spanish though to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The first Eurasians arrived in Singapore shortly after Sir Stamford Raffles
landed on the island in 1819. Similar to other ethnic groups, the Eurasians
of early Singapore lived in communal enclaves. One of the earliest known
Eurasian enclaves was situated in the Waterloo area, along the three roads
of Waterloo Street, Queen Street and Bencoolen Street running parallel
to each other. The houses in the area varied from bungalows to terrace
houses and from shophouses to two-storey homes. As the early Singapore-Eurasians
were Christians, it was no surprise to find them attending churches and
schools in the area. Some of the most notably churches and schools in the
Waterloo area included the Church of Saint Peter and Paul, Saint Joseph
Church, Cathedral of Good Shepherd, and Saint Joseph Institution. As the
Singapore-Eurasian community expanded, they began to fan out to other residential
areas such as Serangoon, Haig Road, Bukit Timah and Katong.</p>
<p>A distinct Singapore-Eurasian identity began to emerge towards the end
of the 1800s when the Eurasians began forming associations to consolidate
themselves and to look after the interests of their community. From the
1880s to the start of the Second World War, there were four main organisations
to which Eurasians affiliated themselves. These were the Singapore Recreation
Club (1883), the Eurasian Association (1919), the Girls’ Sports Club (1929)
and the Eurasian Company of the Singapore Volunteer Corps. In addition,
the Eurasian community also established a number of newspapers since the
1870s as a means to voice their sentiments. Some of these newspapers included
the Straits Intelligence, the Singapore Eurasian Advocate, the Daily Advertiser
(later renamed the Phoenix Press), and the Midday Herald (later renamed
the Straits Telegraph).</p>
<p>Apart from associations and organisations, the Singapore-Eurasian community
also derived some of their cultural identity and sense of community from
the rituals and customs they followed. For Eurasians who are Christians,
the most important festivals are naturally Christmas and Easter. For other
Eurasians who have different faith, they would follow the celebrations
of that particular faith. As with any other community groups the Singapore-Eurasian
community also has their own culture that cuts across areas ranging from
costumes to food.</p>
<p>Due to their fluency in the English language and their European heritage,
the common places of employment for the Eurasians were mainly in the civil
service and the municipality taking on jobs in government departments such
as the Department of Education, Registry of Vehicles, the Police Force
or the Government Monopolies Department (Customs department). Many Eurasians
also served as engineers with the Keppel Harbour Docks and the Singapore
Slipway, while others entered journalism, broadcasting or the private sector
joining established banks and companies such as Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank, Shell Company, Dunlop, Boustead and Adamson Gilfillan. Besides these
professional positions, many Eurasians who obtained education through government
scholarship or family support were among the first lawyers, doctors and
university lecturers in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>Similar to other ethnic communities in Singapore, the Singapore-Eurasian
community produced prominent figures and leaders who contributed in major
ways to their own community and Singapore in general. During the colonial
period, Eurasian leaders such as Edwin John Tessensohn, Noel Leicester
Clarke, Claude Henry da Silva and Percival Frank Aroozoo were instrumental
in strengthening the communal bond and welfare among Eurasians either through
various community works or by representing them in the Legislative Council
or the Straits Settlements Association, while others like Charles Joseph
Pemberton Palgar led the Eurasian community through the Japanese Occupation
and tended to the inhabitants of the failing Eurasian community at Bahau.
Many prominent Eurasians were involved in Singapore’s struggle for independence
as well as the crucial years after independence. Some of them who had taken
key roles in the government and civil service included Edward William Barker,
George Edwin Bogaars, Hedwig Anuar and Dr. Benjamin Henry Shears.</p>
<p>The post-independence era also saw the Eurasians rebuilt their community
bond slowly. In the late 1950s, women were granted membership to the Eurasian
Association and Youth groups were formed to encourage community bonding
through sports and cultural exchanges. However it was only after 1989 that
the Eurasians took on more sustainable efforts through the Eurasian Association
to rekindle the sense of belonging shared among the Eurasians, especially
the younger generation. In fact, 1989 for the Eurasian Association was
known as the year of the Eurasian Awakening as a younger group of Eurasians
decided to take the lead to uplift the community. It was a turning point
as membership of Eurasian Association began to increase, and more elaborate
community bonding programmes and activities were introduced. Furthermore,
it also generated research interest among some Eurasians to trace the community
or their own Eurasian heritage.</p>
<p>To understand the Singapore-Eurasian community and its heritage, this
resource guide lists out the relevant resources and materials that are
found within the collections of the National Library and the National Archives
of Singapore. It also identifies some authoritative resources that can
be found in the web.</p>

<h3><strong>Conducting Family History Search on Singapore-Eurasians</strong></h3>
<p>In general, these resources are useful to delve into for family history
research on Singapore-Eurasians.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Births, deaths and marriages records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clubs and association records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigration and shipping records</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land records and maps</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newspapers</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary resources such as books,
biographies and articles</p>
<p>How these records are used by the featured families in their family history
research is largely dependent on their ethnic and religious background.
For instance, to trace vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage
dates of family members, a Eurasian family, which is of European descent
and often of Christian denomination, may start off with church records.</p>
<p>In addition, as one of the primary goals of family history research is
to trace their ancestors back to the country of origins, it is often that
such research would span beyond the borders of Singapore. For example,
since the Eurasians carry a pedigree of European and Asian, their origins
can be traced to Europeans who migrated en masse to Singapore from Europe
as well as the various European settlements in the region such as Malacca,
Goa, Ceylon, Bencoolen, Macao and Penang in the 19th century. The sources
from which European names are derived are almost endless. It could originate
from nicknames, physical attributes, counties, trades, heraldic charges
and almost every object known to mankind. So for a Eurasian to trace his
or her family tree, the person needs to look at all these possibilities
in order to recognise their ancestors.</p>
<p>To have a general idea on how to build a Eurasian family tree, the following
books from the National Library are a good start collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Government Records and Business Directories</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from records that are related to births, marriages and deaths, names
can also be obtained from publications produced by the Straits Settlements
government given that the person had worked in the government. In these
publications, it is possible to find the person’s name, the government
department that he or she worked in, and in some cases the salary he or
she drew. Besides this, if your ancestors were merchants or businessmen,
there is a good chance that they would be listed in a business directory.
The earliest Singapore business directory was published in 1846 as Singapore
Almanack, Calendar and Directory and the title varies over the years. Below
are some of these publications in the library’s collection.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Church records are another important source of information for genealogy
research. The main types of information you can get from these records
are baptism, marriage and death registrations. As Eurasians are mostly
Roman Catholics, they should be able to find information on their ancestors
in records from the different Roman Catholic churches in Singapore. These
records are currently housed in the National Archives of Singapore. The
Archives also has records of churches from other Christian demoniations
including the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian. Some of the church
records, especially those from the earliest churches in Singapore which
were established in the 1800s and early 1900s, are listed below. Users
are able to search for more church records using the National Archives
of Singapore online catalogue (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nas.gov.sg/archivesonline</a>).</p>
