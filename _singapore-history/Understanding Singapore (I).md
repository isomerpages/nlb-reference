### 1. Introduction

Singapore has transformed from a third world country to a high tech and developed society over the past few decades. There are many external factors that influence how we live and how our nation develops. Learning more about surrounding conditions such as physical, geographical, social and so on, helps us appreciate our country’s progress, constraints and challenges. 

This library guide highlights selected resources on how the environment influences the lives of people in Singapore such as land planning, urbanization and conservation of physical resources.
