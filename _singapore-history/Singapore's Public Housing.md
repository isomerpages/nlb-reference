### <u>Introduction</u>

Singapore is hailed as having achieved unparalleled success in providing low-cost affordable public housing for the masses; and is admired the world over for its town planning and urban management policies. Through them, Singapore transformed its housing landscape from one of slums and squatters into a well-planned distribution of residential townships throughout the island state. The four main features of the public housing policy in Singapore are: strong government support, provision of financial aid in the form of subsidies and housing loans, a sound legislative structure and supportive government policies.

### <u>Laws and Regulations</u>


The housing laws in Singapore spell out the conditions under which a house (public or private) can be rented, bought and sold. These laws are aimed to protect the tenant, the landowner, the buyer and the seller and prevents unscrupulous underhanded dealings which could serve to over inflate the property market and cause property prices to spiral unchecked skywards. For public housing, there are also regulations that govern the usage of the flat, such as converting a residential space to a home-based office. The resources below provide information on Singapore’s housing laws and legislation.

### <u>Build-to-Order Scheme</u>

The BTO scheme was implemented in April 2001 by the Housing Development Board (HDB) to help match the supply of flats to the demand from home seekers. It also gives flat applicants more choices in terms of location, size of their homes and better estimation of when they need to place the down payment for their new flats. Under the scheme, HDB identifies a few sites for new flats but only starts building if demand reaches more than 70 per cent. Tender for construction of these new flats is called only when most of the flats have been booked. The pilot scheme offered about 2,500 flats for sale in four sites in Sembawang and Sengkang in April 2001.

### <u>Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS)</u>


The Design, Build and Sell Scheme was introduced in March 2005 to allow private developers to build public housing to create more choices for flat seekers and inject innovation in the building and design of multi-storey flats, while preserving the main characteristics of public housing, such as maintaining open access to common properties. Under this scheme, private developers are involved in not only the construction of the flats but are also responsible for bidding for the land, designing the flats and their surrounding landscape and selling the flats directly to eligible flat buyers. They are granted the freedom to decide on the design, finish, size and unit configuration of the flat and can sell the flats at a price comparable to those listed on the open market. When the development is completed, HDB then assumes administrative functions of the DBSS flats and the Town Councils will manage the common areas and carparks.

Past DBSS sites include The Premiere @ Tampines, City View @ Boon Keng, Park Central @ Ang Mo Kio, Natura Loft @ Bishan, Parc Lumiere @ Simei and The Peak @ Toa Payoh. Recent DBSS sites are Pasir Ris One@ Pasir Ris, Centrale 8 @ Tampines, Trivelis@ Clementi.

### <u>Statistics</u>

The department of statistics and HDB conduct regular surveys to capture the demographic profiles of residents living in HDB flats. The property market trends in Singapore correspond closely to the country’s economic performance, declining during times of financial downturns and flourishing during the boom periods. The majority of Singaporeans live in public housing and upgrading or downgrading is common as their economic status and demographic profiles of households change. Many people who work and study in Singapore for short durations also rent HDB flats or rooms as these are significantly more affordable, compared to renting private apartments. The following resources provide statistical information on public housing in Singapore, as well as HDB resale and rental trends.

### <u>Urban Planning for Sustainable Development</u>

Long-term sustainable planning for an urban city-state such as Singapore requires the prudent formulation and execution of policies to ensure efficient land and resource use, adequate and affordable public housing and sound infrastructural development to achieve continued economic progress and improve the quality of life for Singaporeans. These policies also need to be flexible to meet the challenges of perpetual changes in the global climate and technology. In the pursuit for prosperity, sustainable development necessitates safeguarding the environment as a way to maintain a high standard of public health and ensure Singapore’s attraction as a desirable place to live and work. It also requires making conscious efforts to conserve energy and water, while investing in R&D to find resource alternatives and taking advantage of new technologies to meet the growing needs of the population in a resource-scarce society.

### <u>Green and Sustainable Architecture</u>

Green and sustainable architecture refers to a building that is designed and constructed to minimise impact on the environment and ensures that the building is resource-efficient (materials, energy, water, space) in its operation and maintenance.

With greater awareness among the masses of the environmental degradation caused by man’s actions, there is a need to ensure that the development of public housing in Singapore does not cause further damage to the environment. To this end, the Housing and Development Board capitalises on green technologies and optimises energy conservation, water management and waste management in developing Singapore’s housing estates.
