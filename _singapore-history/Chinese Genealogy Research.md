<h3><strong>家谱与族谱 Chinese Genealogy Resources</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>介绍</strong>
</p>
<p>家谱是记载本宗族和事迹历史的图籍，它与正史、方志一起，构成中华民族历史学的三大支柱。
<br>
<br>李光前参考图书馆收藏了一些家谱。这些家谱多数是民间个人出版物 （即非卖品）。主要通过公众人士的捐赠。“<em>本馆馆藏内的家谱书目</em>"选列了一些馆藏内的家谱、族谱和人物传记。此外，馆藏也收集了中国主要图书馆汇集的家谱目录。
<br>
<br>方志也是寻根的有用工具。新加坡早期的华人移民主要源自中国南方闽粤两省。想进一步了解新加坡早期华社的情况，请翻阅见"<em>新加坡华社概况</em>"。</p>
<p><em>Jiapu</em> (Family genealogy records) is a type of pictorial publication
that records the history and activities of a Chinese clan. It is one of
the three major publications that documents the history of the Chinese,
with the other two being official history records and local gazetteers.</p>
<p>The Lee Kong Chan Reference Library has a collection of <em>jiapu</em>,
which are mostly private publications that cannot be purchased from the
commercial stores. These <em>jiapu</em> were mostly acquired through public
donations. The Bibliography of the <em>jiapu</em> collection is a select
listing of the <em>jiapu</em>,<em> zupu </em>(Clan genealogy records)<em> </em>and
biographies available in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. In addition,
the library also collects bibliographies of <em>jiapu</em> collections published
by other major libraries in China.</p>
<p>Local gazetteers are also useful for searching information on family roots.
The Chinese in Singapore are mostly descendents from Chinese migrants who
came from the southern part of China - the Fujian and Guangdong provinces.</p>
