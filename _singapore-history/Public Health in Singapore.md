The World Health Organization defines public health as “the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organised efforts of society."[^1] These objectives are achieved through a variety of strategies such as patient education, vaccination and preventive medicine.[^2] 

In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) oversee public health in the areas of public health preparedness, infectious disease prevention and epidemiology, as well as the prevention of transmission of vector borne diseases and keeping public areas clean.[^3] 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore had experienced other infectious disease outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009 and Zika in 2016. These underscored the importance of being vigilant and enhancing capabilities in this area of public health.[^4]

MOH set up the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) as a national centre in 2019 to replace the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) and to strengthen Singapore’s capabilities in infectious disease management and prevention.[^5]

This instalment provides a selection of resources on public health and infectious diseases in Singapore.
