### Introduction
<p>Ever wondered where your ancestors originated, when and how they arrived
at Singapore, who they married, the number of children they had, where
they stayed and what did they do for a living? Or how you always wanted
to trace your family tree to find out how far your ancestry stretches but
have no idea where to begin?</p>
<p>Starting to research one's ancestors can be a daunting, difficult and
confusing task. Besides digging into the memories of family members to
extract basic information such as names, dates and places, the families
also look through their treasure troves to uncover many physical items
or artefacts. The collections at the National Library of Singapore and
the National Archives have materials such as newspapers and records that
can help uncover the information on family history.</p>
<p>The resource guide highlights key resources in the collections of the
National Library and the National Archives of Singapore that are useful
for family history research.</p>
<p></p>

### Resources
<p>In general, family history resources can be obtained from the following:</p>

* Births, deaths and marriages records
* Religious organisation membership records
* School records
* Clubs and association records
* Government records
* Immigration and shipping records
* Land records and maps
* Newspapers
* Secondary resources such as books,
* biographies and articles

<p>The amount of family history information that are searchable is largely
dependent on one's ethnic and religious background. For instance, to trace
vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage dates of family members,
a Eurasian family, which is of European descent and often of Christian
denomination, may start off with church records. A Chinese family, on the
other hand, would consult clans and temple records to locate such information.
For post-independence family members, they may need to consult the Immigration
and Customs Authority.</p>
<p>In addition, as one of the primary goals of family history research is
to trace their ancestors back to the country of origins, it is often that
such research would span beyond the borders of Singapore.</p>
<p></p>

### Research Approach
<p>Start by talking to family and extended family members. These provide
valuable leads from which one can identify or begin planning out what sorts
of records might exist that may help in uncovering family information.</p>
<p>Then, start with the online resources. There are resources online which
will help save time. Newspapers are a good place to start, and you can
search them from online in most cases. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/default.aspx. </a>If
the ancestors are prominent members of society, it is likely there will
be some mention of them. From there, we can possibly glean other information
like the associations they were active in, or the churches they had attended,
which are then leads which one could pursue further at the National Archives.</p>

<p>The National Library published two guides to help people get started on
their family history projects:</p>

<p>They contain oral history checklists with useful questions to guide people
along in locating genealogical records. Some of these records are handwritten
registers, and it takes time to go through them especially when one does
not have a specific date in mind. Be patient as information may not be
readily available. There may not be any records that document one's ancestors’
movement.</p>
<p>Be curious and cast the net wider by researching to check if the family
had even the slightest connection to any organisation. Look up the organisation’s
published resources such as magazines, newsletters, annual reports and
collaterals which may include information such as marriages, birth and
donation by its members and associates.</p>
<p></p>

### Records from the National Archives of Singapore
<p>The National Archives of Singapore has some church records, which require
permission from the churches before viewing is allowed due to privacy concerns.
These have been a rich vein of information to draw up family trees. These
could include handwritten baptism, marriage and death registers, which
are useful in charting out extended family trees!</p>
<p>The National Archives and National Library have also some clan association
records, some of which also hold death and membership registers which may
be useful if you are aware of the dialect group or the hometown your ancestors
came from.</p>
<p>You can search for the available records from our private records database
at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/private_records/advanced-search</a>,
and select the dropdown menu to get a sense of the range of these churches
and other associations we have records of.</p>
<p>In addition to these private records, government records such as burial
registers of municipal also contain information on the individual’s date
of death or where they are buried. The Bukit Brown burial register is available
from the National Archives.</p>
<p>Other sources such as the Blue Books, which are the colonial statistical
returns, are useful if your ancestor was working for the colonial government.
If your ancestor had worked for the colonial government, their names will
be listed there and you can even find out their annual salary!</p>
