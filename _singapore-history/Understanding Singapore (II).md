Violet Onn takes the viewer on a journey to Keong Siak Road, where Tan Ah Seng runs his kopi tiam and shares the magic of the kopi tiam, the life that revolves around it and within. The traditional kopi tiam with its quaint old world charm, is still an attraction for expatriates and locals alike. It represents a microcosm of Singapore life and is to the Singaporean what the teahouse is to the Chinese. Wong Yeh Yuh, president of the Singapore Keng Keow Coffee Association, which was founded in 1934, remembers the Hainanese pioneers who were the first to set up kopi tiams. Another stream of kopi tiam owners came from Foochow. By 1920s, there were more than sixty kopi tiams. In the 80s and 90s, with the industrialisation and economic growth of Singapore, the traditional kopi tiams became less of a family business. However, Chua Beng Huat, associate professor, Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore does not see the death of kopi tiams, although cafes have sprouted up to cater more to the younger and wealthier set of Singaporeans, and the re-discovery of the outside space. The working class culture of the kopi tiams continues in the hawker centres.
