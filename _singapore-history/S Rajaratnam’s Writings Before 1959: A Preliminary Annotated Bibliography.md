<p>Sinnathamby Rajaratnam is best known as Singapore’s first Minister for
Culture and, after independence in 1965, Singapore’s first Minister for
Foreign Affairs. In these two positions, and in other offices in a long
subsequent political career, Rajaratnam theorized Singaporean multiculturalism,
and developed a national foreign policy. His speeches and commentaries
while in Government are well known, and many have been reproduced in two
collections, <em>The Prophetic and the Political</em>, edited by Chan Heng
Chee and Obaid ul Haq, and<em> S. Rajaratnam on Singapore: From Ideas to Reality</em>,
edited by Kwa Chong Guan. Rajaratnam’s short stories, written during his
sojourn in London during the Second World War, and six radio plays he wrote
in the 1950s, have also been collected in Irene Ng’s <em>The Short Stories and Radio Plays of S. Rajaratnam</em>.
The majority of Rajaratnam’s writings before he entered the first People’s
Action Party cabinet on 5 June 1959, however, were published in newspapers
and magazines during his career as a journalist. Few of these are listed
in bibliographical sources: Gandhimathy Durairaj and Linda Yip Seong Chun’s <em>S. Rajaratnam: A Bibliography</em>,
for instance, makes scant reference to material before 1959.</p>
<p>This bibliography attempts a preliminary listing of Rajaratnam’s print
publications before Singapore’s achievement of self-government in 1959.
During his time in London from 1935 to 1947, Rajaratnam published articles
and short stories in magazines in Britain and in the United States, and
journalism in left-wing newspapers in London, as well as an early article
in a Penang newspaper. After his return to Singapore in 1947, he worked
first for the <em>Malaya Tribune</em>, and then from 1950 onwards for the <em>Singapore Standard</em>.
After an abortive and financially ruinous effort to found <em>Raayat</em>,
“a magazine for educated Malayans,” Rajaratnam began working for the <em>Straits Times</em> in
early 1955, resigning in election year in 1959.</p>
<p>The bibliography only lists articles that carry Rajaratnam’s byline, or
which can be definitively identified as being by him from other contemporary
sources. A large body of his work does not carry bylines. In London, Rajaratnam
cut his journalistic teeth writing news articles for publications such
as <em>Reynold’s News</em>, and he also served as London correspondent for
the Bombay-based <em>Free Press Journal</em>. In Singapore, he wrote many
editorials and other articles without bylines in the <em>Tribune </em>and
the <em>Standard</em>, and also acted as a correspondent for the London-based <em>Observer </em>and
its international news service. In this bibliography I have been extremely
cautious in including articles without a byline. I have only listed such
articles which, from contemporary sources, are clearly identified as being
by Rajaratnam. An example of this is Rajaratnam’s December 1949 review
of University of Malaya Economics professor Thomas Silcock’s <em>Dilemma in Malaya</em>,
which is unsigned, but whose authorship emerges during the acrimonious
debate that emerged from Silcock’s letter in response. Following this principle,
I have also excluded anonymous or pseudonymous editorials and longer articles
from the magazine <em>Raayat </em>which are clearly in Rajaratnam’s style,
and pseudonymous articles, again distinctively in his style, from the People’s
Action Party publication <em>Petir </em>during his tenure as editor. I have
been unable to examine a full run of Petir, and so some articles published
under Rajaratnam’s byline may still be missing from the bibliography as
it stands. Finally, in the absence of contemporary external evidence, I
have not included the many news articles and editorials from his period
at <em>Singapore Standard </em>that were likely written by him, and which
contributed to his eventual resignation from the <em>Standard </em>when
he refused to align his politics with that of the newspaper’s proprietor,
Aw Boon Haw. For an account of some of this journalism, see Irene Ng’s <em>The Singapore Lion: A Biography of S. Rajaratnam</em>,
especially chapters 7 and 9. In the case when an article or short story
is subsequently reprinted, I have only included details of its first publication.</p>
