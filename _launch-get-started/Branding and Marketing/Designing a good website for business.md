# Designing a Good Website for Business  

A website is an excellent way for your business to reach potential customers, particularly if you are a small business owner looking to grow your customer base. Whether you own a brick-and-mortar store or an online business, a website is an extension of your business and will help you attract and retain new customers.  

## Why have a website? 

A website is easily trackable, allowing brands to better understand consumer behaviour and offering insights into what is and isn’t working with regards to the business and even its marketing strategies. It also provides benefits such as increasing sales and leads. Having a site search feature or contact form allows you to respond quickly to enquiries from your customers.  

A well-designed website will draw people in, encourage them to browse your site, and perhaps even persuade them make a purchase or use your services. It will leave a lasting and favourable impression of your company and retain leads on your page. On the flip side, a poorly designed website might confuse customers and deter them from buying anything or engaging your services.  

Good website design is an asset that will set you apart from your competitors. It will aid in the development of your website's search engine optimisation, or SEO, which is crucial in making your website rank more highly in search results. The functionality of your website is an important aspect of SEO, and your site might not rank well if it is badly designed or poorly coded. 

## What makes a website well-designed? 

To create a website that is well designed, there are many different elements to consider such as white space, font, how best to present your services and how user friendly it is. In addition, there are also basic features to include from having a search information to contact details. 

Even before you start, it is good to plan how the website will be structured and the hierarchy of information that will be put up. The type of business that you have on offer, be it an SME, online business or a freelancer will also determine the design and type of information that will need to be developed, bearing in mind your target audience and objectives. 

As more and more of our lives go online, it is important for businesses to properly market their businesses online and have a strong digital presence.
