<h1>What is copyright and how to avoid copyright infringement</h1>
<p>Copyright protects the expression of ideas in tangible forms. In Singapore,
copyright is governed by the Copyright Act. The aim of copyright is to
encourage the production and dissemination of new work by authors, musicians,
film makers, performers, photographers, broadcasters and other content
creators by awarding them the exclusive right to reproduce, publish, perform,
communicate or adapt their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, for the work which is created by an employee during the course
of his or her employment, the copyright belongs to the employer. In the
case of an employee who writes for a publication such as a newspaper or
magazine however, the employer would have a limited copyright ownership
and the employee retains the right to publish the work elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duration of copyright protection varies according to the type of work.
In Singapore, the copyright for literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works generally lasts for 70 years after the author’s death. After copyright
ends, the work passes into public domain. This means that anyone can use
and adapt the work without requiring permission from the copyright owner.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copyright protects the following types of materials:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literary works (e.g. books, poems, song lyrics)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dramatic works (e.g. film scripts, choreography)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Musical works (e.g. melodies)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artistic works (e.g. paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings, photographs)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sound recordings (e.g. podcasts, music)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Films (e.g. movies, videos)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Television and radio broadcasts&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cable programmes&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performances (e.g. performances by musicians, singers, and comedians)2&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Copyright infringement&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Copyright infringement is when someone uses or makes a copy of the copyright
owner’s work without his or her consent. An example of copyright infringement
is when a performance in Singapore is recorded without the copyright owner’s
permission and copies of the recording are distributed for sale either
locally or overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, there are a few options to resolve copyright
infringement, such as negotiation, mediation or taking legal action.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exceptions to copyright infringement&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CA2021?ProvIds=P15-#P15-" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Part 5 of the Copyright Act 2021</u></a> details
the permitted uses of copyrighted works and protected performances. In
these cases, the act is not an infringement of any copyright in the work.
Under the ‘Fair Use’ exemption for instance, the courts will take the following
areas into consideration when deciding if the exemption is applicable:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the purpose and character of the use (commercial or non-profit)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the nature of the work or performance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amount of copyrighted work used in relation to the entire work or
performance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the
work or performance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is best to seek legal counsel for any queries on copyright matters,
to ensure that your own work is protected or to check that you have not
inadvertently infringed on the copyright of someone else.&nbsp;</p>
