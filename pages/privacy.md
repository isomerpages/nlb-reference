The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred digital services.

b. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the digital services.
