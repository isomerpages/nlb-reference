### <u>Introduction</u>

English is the most widely spoken language in the world with over 360 million native speakers and more than 750 million second language learners. It is the international lingua franca for social, cultural, scholarly and business discourse among people of different countries and continents.

English is the official language of more than 60 sovereign states, ranging from Botswana and Cameroon in the African continent to Fiji in Oceania and Ireland in the European continent to Trinidad and Tobago in North America. It is also one of the official languages for non-sovereign entities such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands in America, Christmas Island and Pitcairn Islands in Oceania, Hong Kong in Asia and Gibraltar and the Isle of Man in Europe.

This guide provides resources that cover the structure, development and functions of the English language that are available at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library as well as on the Internet. As the guide is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources.

### <u>History</u>

The history of the English language can be traced back to the 5th century A.D. invasion of Britain by three Germanic tribes from Germany and Denmark – the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes. Celtic was the spoken language among the British of the period and the original inhabitants were driven West and North, towards lands that are now known as Scotland, Ireland and Wales.

The Germanic tribes spoke a language which evolved to become Old English (450-1100 A.D.). Britain was again invaded in 1066 by William the Conqueror from Normandy, who introduced French into the English language, which became Middle English, and was spoken until around the 15th century.

A change in the pronunciation of English towards the end of the 15th century resulted in vowels being shortened. New words and phrases were also introduced into the English language, transforming it into Early Modern English (1600-1800).

The English spoken today is known as Late Modern English, which had its roots in the turn of the 19th century, as many foreign words began to be adopted into the English vernacular and new words were created arising from the industrial revolution and the widespread application of technology. A list of print materials listed below, together with online resources, provides more information on the history of the English Language.

### <u>Phonology</u>

Phonology is the ‘grammar of sound’ and studies the sound system (speech sounds/patterns or phonemes) in a language. The sound system is made up of the pronunciation of words and the prosody (pitch, loudness). In most languages, there is a set of rules that govern how sounds relate to one another, determining for example, which sounds can be combined and in what sequential order.

Being phonologically aware means that one understands how speech can be segmented and manipulated and hence is useful for developing literacy and in enhancing one’s reading ability.

### <u>Grammar</u>

English grammar refers to the set of rules that govern how words, phrases, clauses and sentences are structured in the English language. Knowing basic English grammar enables one to be a more effective writer, advances one’s reading comprehension, encourages a deeper appreciation for literary texts such as prose and poetry and facilitates clear and precise verbal and written communication for different audiences and purposes.

Learning about grammar terminology also cultivates an understanding and respect for the way other languages and dialects are structured and used.

You can search the library catalogue (for physical materials) in the library and from home (http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg). The easy search function allows you to search/browse by author, title, keyword, subject and ISBN/ISSN whereas the advanced search allows you to narrow your searches to specific media types or language holdings.
