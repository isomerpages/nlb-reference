### <u>Introduction</u>

Linguistics is the scientific study of language, which can be broadly divided into numerous areas of study, including morphology (word structure), syntax (phrase and sentence structure), phonetics/phonology (sound system), and semantics/pragmatics (meaning).

The various fields of linguistics cover a wide range of research and application, including language documentation, language acquisition and education, sociolinguistics, neurolinguistics, corpus linguistics, translation, and interpretation.

This guide highlights resources on linguistics that are available at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library as well as on the Internet. As the guide is not intended to be comprehensive, interested readers should search the NLB catalogue or the Internet for more resources.
