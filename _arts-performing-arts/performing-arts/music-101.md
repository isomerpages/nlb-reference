<h3><u>Accessing National Library Board Singapore Resources</u></h3>
<p><strong><u>Accessing the Print Materials</u></strong>
</p>
<p>You can search the library catalogue (for physical materials) in the library
and from home (http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg). The easy search function allows
you to search/browse by author, title, keyword, subject and ISBN/ISSN whereas
the advanced search allows you to narrow your searches to specific media
types or language holdings. In both instances, you will also be able to
limit your search to specific libraries by clicking on the “limit by branch”
option.</p>
