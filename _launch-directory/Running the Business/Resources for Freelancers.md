# Resources for Freelancers

In collaboration with **NTUC's Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit ([U FSE](https://ufse.org.sg/))**, here are some resources curated for freelancers and the self-employed.

- The [**Business Fundamentals Toolkit for Freelancers**](https://ufse.org.sg/PublishingImages/Lists/Listing%20Summary/AllItems/NTUC%20U%20FSE%20-%20Toolkit%20for%20Freelancers%202022-07-27.pdf) aims to provide basic guidance to the freelancers as they set off on their entrepreneurial journey.

- [**Template for Key Terms of Engagement for Self Employed Persons**](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/employment-practices/kets/template-key-terms-of-engagement-seps.docx?la=en&hash=9786B02E97513CE26DBC1D496A3CCF2D%E2%80%8B): The MOM has developed a form template for SEPs on the key terms of engagement, in accordance with the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with SEPs (TS SEPs).
